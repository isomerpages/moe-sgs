<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) Celebration provided a platform for students to present a wide range of societal issues ranging form strengthening school identify to meeting the needs of the elderly and dementia patients, encouraging self-sufficiency in food, enhancing security in the community, mitigating climate change to promoting the use of MTL. There were many innovative solutions proposed by the students. It was a great opportunity for the groups to share their learning and garner the support of their peers to vote for the most popular project.</p>
