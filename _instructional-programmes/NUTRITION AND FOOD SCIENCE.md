Following up with Food and Nutrition we aim to develop studentsâ€™ understanding of concepts of nutrition and food science. With the use of inquiry-based learning and ICT in Food and Nutrition and Food Studies Coursework, students will become socially aware responsible self-directed learners.

##### **Signature Programmes**
###### Partnership with TOUCH Diabetes

Food and Nutrition students become active contributors and concerned citizens as they partner with TOUCH Diabetes, creating modified meals for diabetic patients. Students learn more about meal planning and put into practice the knowledge and skills they gained in the classroom to create the meals.

###### **Lower Secondary Healthy Breakfast Meals**

Food and Consumer Education students learn the importance of a healthy breakfast as well as entrepreneurship skills in order to sell their breakfast meals.
