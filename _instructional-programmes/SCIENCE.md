The SGS Science department aims to inculcate in our students a strong interest and joy in the learning of Science, nurture positive scientific values and attitudes by providing varied, authentic, relevant and real-world learning experiences so as to nurture effective and competent contributors. We strive to enable our students to seek data and information to validate observations of phenomena with a scientific mindset and inquiring mind, to understand scientific applications in the real world.
