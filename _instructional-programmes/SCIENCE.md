The SGS Science department aims to inculcate in our students a strong interest and joy in the learning of Science, nurture positive scientific values and attitudes by providing varied, authentic, relevant and real-world learning experiences so as to nurture effective and competent contributors. We strive to enable our students to seek data and information to validate observations of phenomena with a scientific mindset and inquiring mind, to understand scientific applications in the real world.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Hydroponics Research Programme focuses on connecting students’ knowledge learnt in school to solve real-world issues such as food security problems through Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). It also aims to develop learning dispositions such as resilience and adaptability when conducting their research. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> As part of the Hydroponics Enrichment Programme, the Science department collaborated with the school’s CCE ambassadors in our Be-. Up- project. The project involved the growing of sweet Thai basil plants in our Hydroponics greenhouse, with the aim of promoting awareness of urban farming and sustainable living. The Teachers’ Day cards, personalized bookmark/ nametag, and cards designed with the laminated basil leaves aim to celebrate all SGS staff who dedicatedly brave the rain or shine each day to shelter and nurture the seeds of the future. “The flowers that bloom tomorrow are the seeds that we plant today.” </p>
