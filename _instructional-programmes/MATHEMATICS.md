##### **Our Belief**

The Math Department believe that all students can learn and want to learn. We believe in teaching our students how to learn and build up their confidence as they improve over time. To us, hope, confidence and thus motivation are the most important factors in learning.

##### **Self-Directed and Self-Paced Learning**

Many students believe that their teachers are the best source to learn from. However, there are often 30+ students and only 1 teacher in a class. We believe instead, that most students should learn from videos created by their teachers and reserve the teacher for those who still have doubts after watching the videos. This way, we train students to take ownership of their own studies by giving them a way to learn at their own time and pace. Many (both teachers and students) are often surprised at how many students will actually learn in advance once they have a means to do it. These online resources are always available and thus helpful for revision too.
