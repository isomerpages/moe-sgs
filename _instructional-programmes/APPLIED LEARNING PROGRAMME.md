<p style="text-align: justify;"> The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP), ‘Researching Society through Media Literacy’ (RSM<sup>L</sup>), aims to nurture students to become “Critical Thinkers. Thoughtful Leaders”. It hopes to deepen their 21st Century Competencies (21CC) through a focus on metacognition understanding using various thinking routines, drawing on the creativity of the students to benefit the society through the use of the Design-Thinking process. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the school seeks to nurture eco-stewards of the environment through the ALP. The overarching theme for 2022 is ‘Environment and Us’, which draws focus on the individual’s action in waste reduction and the reduction of the carbon footprint. The research process using Design Thinking as a key approach will be facilitated in the different academic disciplines (such as Humanities, Math, Science, English, Art, Food and Consumer Education, Design & Technology, Mother Tongue Languages and Physical Education) to bring about authentic learning experiences that will ignite the students’ passion to learn for life. In this learning process, students will deepen their understanding of environmental issues that are pertinent to building a more sustainable city. They will also learn to engage different stakeholders to champion green actions. Through interactions with their families, parents, teachers, friends and community partners, their perspectives and knowledge will be broadened. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To recognize the students’ development of 21CC, the ALP Celebration Award Presentation will be conducted every semester to celebrate students’ achievement in bringing positive change to the community they are in. </p>
