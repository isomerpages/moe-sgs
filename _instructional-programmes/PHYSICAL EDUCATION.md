The Physical Education Department aims to develop our students to be physical activity loving, healthy, knowledgeable in sports related areas, confident individuals portraying values of sportsmanship who are team players.


At Serangoon Garden Secondary School, we believe in educating students to enjoy and appreciate living active and healthy lifestyles through a Physical Education programme that is engaging and varied. We teach a variety of sports over the four to five years at SGS, namely, table tennis, floorball, basketball, badminton, football, volleyball and softball, netball. On top of this we introduce sports like tennis and missile-golf.

Our Outdoor Education (OE) and Physical Health & Fitness (PHF) modules teach students the fundamentals of being independent and be able to negotiate with nature and the environment such as map reading and navigation, bouldering, and learning to start fires from scratch with firewood. For PHF, we teach several areas of health and Physical Education related topics such as basic anatomy, basic first aid, and add-on topics like nutrition and hydration, which are areas that are equally important and complement oneâ€™s active lifestyle.

**Signature Programmes**

At Serangoon Garden Secondary, Physical Education is not just about the play, competition, physical activity and fitness. It is about teaching the life skills that can be learnt through sports. Values such as sportsmanship, discipline, diligence, and being responsible are taught constantly as the teachers continuously facilitate and draw out these learning points at every opportunity.


The PE programme provides many opportunities to play in the many sports recreationally, at the intra class and inter class levels and at the house levels. Students get to compete with each other in mini and improvised games in PE, at our Level Signature Programmes (LSP), Post Exam games, ACES day, at Sports Fiesta and in the Inter-house championships.

Our Sec Ones learn several sports outside of the PE syllabus such as Tchoukball, Archery, Tag Rugby and go through hands-on lessons on creating and cooking healthy meals.

Our Sec Threes get to attend the Cohort Outdoor Adventure Camp at the various outdoor campsites where they experience sleeping in tents, outdoor cooking and navigation through the various nature parks and outdoor spaces in Singapore.
