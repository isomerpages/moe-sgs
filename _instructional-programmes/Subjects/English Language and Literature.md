#### Department Vision: Language for Life and Learning

#### Department Mission: Cultivating Competent, Confident and Clear Communicators (5Cs)

The English Language (EL) and Literature Department has the vision of ‘Language for Life and Learning’, which encompasses our hope that students leave SGSS with the necessary reading, viewing, speaking, writing and listening skills. They should also bring along with them a zest for life and an ability to appreciate the beauty of the language. The Department Mission: Cultivating Competent, Confident and Clear Communicators (5Cs) firmly encapsulates what we do as teachers of English Language and Literature and our desired student outcomes.
In the EL and Literature classrooms, students can look forward to lessons crafted to develop students’ language competencies. Some highlights of EL and Literature lessons in SGSS include:

•	Use of Google Classroom and SLS as part of Blended Learning <br>
•	Use of Artificial Intelligence Assisted software in writing.<br>
•	Collaborative learning and alternative assessment methods focusing on speech and drama, and creative writing.<br>
•	Use of journals as a tool for emotion regulation and thematic reflection

To nurture students in EL and Literature beyond the classroom, students have opportunities to engage in key programmes which include Garden Expressions: Thoughts in Bloom (an oracy competition), READ@SGSS, participation in creative writing, literary debate, drama and choral reading competitions in the National Schools Literature Festival, theatre trips and many more.

#### Key programmes
##### Garden Expressions: Thoughts in Bloom (GETB)
The objectives of the GETB programme are to foster effective thinking and communication skills while providing a platform for students to express their authentic voice. Initially an in-house competition, GETB has grown into an inter-school event, allowing students to learn from peers in other institutions.

##### READ@SGSS

READ@SGSS is a reading programme that aims to develop in students beginning, close and critical reading and viewing skills, strategies, attitudes and behaviour (SSABs) to comprehend a variety of texts meaningfully, strengthened with wide and extensive reading and viewing. Apart from morning reading periods, SGSS also holds book fairs and movie screenings (text to screen) to further encourage the love of reading among  students.
