**Principles of Accounts (POA)** is an elective subject offered to upper secondary school students. Serangoon Garden Secondary Schoolâ€™s POA Unit aims to help students develop critical thinking and communication skills when they analyse information, make decisions based on it and present their decisions. We adopt a mixed mode delivery, such as demonstration, games, inquiry and authentic learning using business examples to encourage our students in learning.  
  
### Benefits of learning POA  
Through the study of accounting, students will develop a keen eye for detail and acquire transferrable skills such as organizing and analyzing information for decision-making, and apply these skills in their daily lives. Using accounting and non-accounting information, students learn to make decisions and become critical thinkers who solve problems and adapt to the evolving needs of stakeholders. Students will also understand the importance of values such as integrity and objectivity when communicating and making decisions.  
  
### Curriculum Content  
Students will acquire knowledge and understanding of fundamental accounting theories, principles and procedures. Students will learn to appreciate the accounting information system, apply double entry system of recording business transactions, and organize and present accounting information in ledger accounts and financial statements. Students will also analyse effects of accounting transactions, interpret ledgers and financial statements, and make business decisions in scenario based questions. For O level students, they will also evaluate efficiency of business in terms of profitability, liquidity, inventory and trade receivable managements using financial information and ratios.
