SGS **Art** Unit aims to instill in our students the love for visual arts through the development of artistic skills of observation, creative expression and appreciation.  
  
**Lower secondary:** Various streams have specialized curriculums to cater to studentsâ€™ learning needs - performance tasks and projects.  
  
**Upper secondary:** Emphasis placed on both technical skills and concept - research, exploration, development, experimentation and evaluation.

### Enrichment lessons and LSP Programmes  
Through enrichment lessons, students are given the opportunity to work with artists to learn techniques such as watercolour and 3-D animal mask making etc. LSP programmes are also organised for students to develop their visual awareness and heighten their sensitivities. Students will learn how to generate ideas that express and communicate their thoughts, experiences and feelings in visual form as well as tap into their creative imagination.  
  
### Art Competitions  
Students are encouraged to participate in Art competitions, such as the Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition, Yellowren Inter-school Canvas Art Competition and the MTC - Design For Good Youth Competition, to further develop and enhance their interest and exposure in Art.  
  
Through these, students will acquire applied learning skills like collaboration, research, creativity, inquiry skills and build their self-awareness. These are applicable life skills which transcend the subject and will aid students in their post-secondary education.
