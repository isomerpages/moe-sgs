## Outline of Curriculum  
Design process is the key platform in Design & Technology. It guides the act of conceptualising and creating design solutions that are practical and appropriate in everyday life. Students undertake a series of design and make projects progressively (from Secondary 1 to 4/5) to acquire new knowledge and skills through this learning platform.  

Students are also encouraged to take part in enrichment programmes such as seminars and competitions to apply their knowledge learned in class and reinforce their learning

### Lower secondary  
In the lower secondary level, students learn through design-and-make projects. As students immerse in these projects, they will acquire related knowledge and develop skills to turn ideas into reality.  

### Upper secondary  
In the upper secondary level, students learn to identify design opportunities in the community, understand the needs of the user, and then work independently to design and prototype innovative solutions that meet those needs.  
  
In the process of working on design and make projects, students are able to develop 21st century competencies – skills like civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills, critical and inventive thinking, and communication, collaboration and information and skills.  
This is in line with the SGS’s vision of “Learners with Grit, Leaders with Heart”.
