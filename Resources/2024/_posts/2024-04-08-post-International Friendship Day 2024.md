<p>This year’s theme for the International Friendship Day (IFD) celebrations
was ‘Singapore in Asia.’ Throughout last week, students engaged in various
activities, such as learning more about ASEAN countries through an exhibition
and Kahoot games, and to cook international cuisine in FCE lessons.</p>
<p>We also welcomed the Principal, Vice Principal, teachers and students
from the International French School (IFS); the IFS students made the Assembly
programme extra special with their band and dance performances. These opportunities
encouraged our students to develop a global outlook, to cherish and strengthen
existing friendships, and to forge new ones.</p>
