<p>The annual SGS Cross Country Run took place against the scenic backdrop
of Bedok Reservoir on May 3, 2024. As the sun painted rainbows across the
sky, we gathered to celebrate the harmony of mind and body, running alongside
friends and mentors. The event enabled students to develop perseverance
and teamwork, and strengthened connections within the school community.
Despite obstacles, students demonstrated resilience and the indomitable
spirit of SGS. With unwavering support and encouragement from staff and
students at the checkpoints, everyone crossed the finishing line successfully!</p>
