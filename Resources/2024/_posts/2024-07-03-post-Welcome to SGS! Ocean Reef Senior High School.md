<p>Teachers and students from Ocean Reef Senior High School (ORSHS), Perth,
visited SGS on 28 June 2024. As part of the Youth Day celebration, student
bands from ORSHS performed to a rousing crowd of SGS students and staff.
Our guests also participated in various lessons activities, ranging from
song performances in Music, choral reading in Literature, colouring in
the style of Romero Britto in Art and even a friendly game of Floorball
during PE. The visit ended on a high note with a skills exchange between
ORSHSâ€™ performing bands and our Performing Arts CCAs.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the SGS Buddies from Choir and Band, the wonderful performers
from LAC, Guzheng and Dance, and all staff and students who have made the
visit a success!</p>
