<p>SGS Wellness Champions are committed to fostering a culture of care and
inclusivity in SGS, where every student feels valued and supported. They
organised Games Day on 17 May, after school, for students to bond through
fun and meaningful activities like board games, foosball, and air hockey.
Students had the opportunity to unwind, strengthen friendships, and make
new connections. Some of them also won attractive prizes. We look forward
to our next Games Day in Term 3!</p>
