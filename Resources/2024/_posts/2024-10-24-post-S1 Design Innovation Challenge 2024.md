<p>In May, forty passionate students from Serangoon Garden Secondary School,
Presbyterian High School, and Yio Chu Kang Secondary School embarked on
a 6-month journey of creativity and innovation. Beginning with an intensive
two-day workshop, students embraced a blended learning approach, engaging
in face-to-face workshops with online pitching consultations led by the
Innovation Committee at SGS and Assistant Professor Nadya Patel from the
Singapore Institute of Technology. This experience pushed them to think
critically, apply inventive solutions, and hone their communication skills.
The grand finale of this challenge took place on 24 Oct, where each team
impressed the audience with their creativity and dedication to making a
positive impact on the community. Congratulations to all the students for
their hard work and remarkable achievements!</p>
