<p>Student leadership renewal was the focus for the past few weeks in SGS,
as the Class Committee members, CCA Leaders, and Student Councillors had
their Investitures, witnessed by the entire school. The Class Committees
were appointed on 5th April in a meaningful ceremony where Form Teachers
formally pinned collar badges on Class Committee members.</p>
<p>On 17th April, the school witnessed the changing of the guard as the Secondary
Three Student Councillors and CCA Leaders were given the mandate to take
the lead for their new term of service, while the graduating batch of Secondary
Four student leaders were recognised for their efforts over the past year.
The different groups of leaders were united by one common purpose: to be
Learners with Grit, Leaders with Heart.</p>
