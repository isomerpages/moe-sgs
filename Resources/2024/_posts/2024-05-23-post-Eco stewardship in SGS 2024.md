<p>In Term 2, our SGS Green Champs were involved in a farm-to-table project.
From germination to transplantation, to growing, and eventually harvesting
the Kale and Bok Choy in the school’s Hydroponics Greenhouse, the Green
Champs learned about the hard work that goes into every dish on their tables,
and the importance of urban farming in Singapore’s journey towards food
sustainability.</p>
<p>Students excitedly distributed some of the freshly harvested vegetables
to SGS staff, while the rest were brought to the food lab to be cooked
into some yummy dishes. They certainly had fun reaping the fruits (or rather,
vegetables) of their own labour, and cooking fusion cuisine – including
Kale pizza, Kimchi-Bok Choy – whilst enjoying the company of friends and
teachers.</p>
