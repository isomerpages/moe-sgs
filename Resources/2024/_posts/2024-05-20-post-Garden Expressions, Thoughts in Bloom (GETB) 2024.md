<p>GETB, the signature oracy programme at SGS, develops our students to be
confident and effective communicators. It provides a platform for students
to use their personal voices to inspire and motivate change.</p>
<p>This yearâ€™s event saw 10 finalists and over 300 audience participants
from our South 1 (S1) family of schools. It was an enjoyable afternoon
enriched by thoughtful speeches and specially curated booths showcasing
students' projects, all anchored on the theme of sustainable development.
Special thanks to our guest-of-honour, Mr Ling Khoon Chow, our esteemed
judges, Ms Jennifer Lim, Ms Suneeta Menon, Ms Lee Huixin, and NYP friends
for making the occasion extra special!</p>
<p>Congratulations to Celestina Wee for emerging champion in the Upper Sec
category, and Daffney Mendoza for emerging first runner-up in the Lower
Sec category!</p>
