<p>SGS marked our nation’s 59th birthday with a highly-anticipated National
Day Parade and concert celebrating Singapore’s success and unity, in line
with the 2024 theme of ‘Together, As One United People’. The concert ended
on a rousing note with SGS singing all-time favourite National Day songs,
united in our excited and hopeful outlook for Singapore’s future!</p>
