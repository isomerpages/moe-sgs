<p>Over the past four days, the Secondary 1 students went through our Orientation
Programme organised by our Student Council. The students made new friends
and were inducted into our various school programmes. They also experienced
the various CCAs on offer at the CCA orientation. The Orientation Programme
concludes with a celebration filled with dance and song performances.</p>
<p>Once again, we welcome all Secondary 1 students to the SGS family.</p>
<p>May the Serangoon Garden flame burn bright!</p>
