<p>In line with PM Wong's recent announcement at the National Day Rally on
the upcoming enhancements to school facilities for students to learn, interact,
and collaborate, we are thrilled to celebrate our Sec 1 students’ ALP Projects
on designing purposeful learning spaces in school.</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement of the showcase, were our guest judges from Ho
Bee Land who shared insights on sustainable space design and provided words
of encouragement and advice for students’ innovative proposals.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our winners and participants! Your creativity and
dedication have truly shone through, and we can't wait to see how your
ideas will shape the future of learning spaces.</p>
