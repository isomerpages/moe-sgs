<p>This week, we celebrate the work of young changemakers from Serangoon
Garden Secondary School, Presbyterian High School, and Yio Chu Kang Secondary
School. The ongoing public showcase of poster displays of the projects
and the prototypes, is held at Punggol Regional Library (Level 4) till
8 November. The showcase highlights education’s power to drive societal
change, providing a platform for meaningful dialogue between youth and
the community.</p>
<p>We’re excited to see these young innovators grow and contribute to a more
sustainable and inclusive Singapore. Their journey through design thinking
and community engagement - anchored on the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals - demonstrates the potential of youth to shape the future for generations
to come.</p>
