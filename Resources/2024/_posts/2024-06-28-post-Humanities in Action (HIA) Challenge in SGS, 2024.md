<p>Students from 12 secondary schools came together to share their passion
for the Humanities, and enjoy quizzes, games and activities, in line with
this year's theme of ‘Echoes of Time: Preserving History, Shaping Sustainability’.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the Guest-of-honour, Mr Kelvin Tay (Director, Humanities
Branch, MOE), the organising team of teachers and student helpers from
Serangoon Garden Secondary School and Admiralty Secondary School, and to
all the enthusiastic participants who made this a truly memorable and joyful
afternoon!</p>
