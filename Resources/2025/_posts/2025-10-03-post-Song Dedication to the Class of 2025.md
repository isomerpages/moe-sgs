<p>Congratulations on completing this important chapter of your journey -
we are proud of how far you have come!</p>
<p>Song title: 最初的地方 (The Place Where It All Began)</p>
<p>Lyricist &amp; Composer: Ng Chun Siang (黄俊翔), Yong Sze Ze (杨时泽)</p>
<p>This song is a tribute to Serangoon Garden Secondary School - the place
where dreams began. It celebrates growth, courage, and memories, built
through shared struggles and the guidance of dedicated teachers. As the
journey at SGS comes to an end, it expresses gratitude and the bittersweet
emotions of saying goodbye.</p>
