<p>Secondary One students immersed themselves in a vibrant fusion of cultures
and the Arts during LSP week. They experienced the rhythmic beats of the
Kompang, the powerful sounds of Chinese drums, the intensity of Silat,
the elegance of Indian dance, and the fiery passion of Flamenco. It was
truly a sight to behold as the students performed what they had learnt
that day, showcasing their newfound skills/core muscles and artistic flair.
Students also enjoyed the Tchoukball matches, where they exhibited their
sporting prowess.</p>

<p>In line with the Secondary 2 theme, "Building Connections, Supporting
Peers," students engaged in applied learning modules, learning journeys,
and leadership programmes to strengthen bonds with peers and the community.
From arts and media explorations, learning journeys to Edible Garden City,
makerspaces, and the National Museum, to Applied Learning Modules where
students gained skills in pastry making, video production, sports management,
business, healthcare, and STEM (F1 in Schools programmme), the experiences
allowed students to explore interests, apply knowledge to real-world applications,
and build new friendships.</p>

<p>At the Sec 3 Cohort Camp, students challenged themselves to go beyond
their comfort zones in the various outdoor and adventure activities. Through
it all, they developed greater resilience and appreciation for the great
outdoors. As they faced challenges and their fears, they learnt to support
one another to overcome these together.</p>

<p>Sec 4 and 5 students visited post-secondary institutions and explored
the learning facilities there. They also gained insights into the courses
offered and the diverse experiences, such as internships. They interacted
with current students and lecturers at the institutions, gaining a firsthand
perspective on navigating post-secondary pathways successfully. Through
the in-school ECG programme, students reflected on their strengths and
interests, explored courses, and learned how to better prepare for EAE/DSA
applications.</p>
