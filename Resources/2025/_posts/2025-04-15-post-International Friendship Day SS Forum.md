<p>In line with International Friendship Day, students engaged in a thought-provoking
Social Studies Forum focusing on Singaporeâ€™s global relevance and unique
value proposition. Student panelists assumed various roles as ministers
and institutional representatives, to tackle a fictional cross-border issue,
while navigating international relations and national interests. This year,
AI-generated questions were used to guide student panelists in refining
their perspectives and deepening their understanding. All in, it was a
meaningful dialogue that prepared students for the realities and complexities
of global citizenship!</p>
