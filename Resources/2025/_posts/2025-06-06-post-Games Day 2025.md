<p>SGS Wellness Champs continue to champion a culture of care and inclusivity.
SGS Games Day, held on 29 May after school, provided students with the
opportunity to relax and connect through engaging activities like board
games, foosball, air hockey, and our newly launched pool table. SGS-ians
strengthened old friendships and built new ones. We look forward to more
fun, friendship, and exciting prizes, at our next Games Day in Term 3!</p>
