<p>30 Secondary 3 students embarked on an enriching and unforgettable trip
to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Over the course of four days, they learnt
more about Vietnam’s war history as they trudged through the Cu Chi Tunnels,
explored the War Remnants Museum, and the Independence Palace. They also
engaged in hands-on activities and shared meaningful exchanges with local
students. Students also explored the Mekong Delta and learnt about Saigon’s
culture and innovations when they visited the Saigon Hi-Tech Park and a
local barista school. Through it all, students gained cross-cultural skills
and a deeper understanding of the place of Singapore in ASEAN and the world.</p>
