<p>Syawal marks the end of the fasting month in Ramadan. Hereâ€™s a throwback
to the colourful Hari Raya festivities in SGS, ranging from a folk performance
by Sri Mahligai, a sampin-wearing competition, an interactive quiz, to
a Classroom Decoration competition where our PSG gamely supported as judges.
At the Hari Raya booth display, students wove mini ketupats, explored traditional
outfits, and sampled modern and traditional cookies.</p>
