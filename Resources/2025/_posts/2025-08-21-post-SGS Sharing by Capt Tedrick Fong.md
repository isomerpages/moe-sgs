<h3>Welcome Back, Capt. Tedrick Fong (Class of 2014)!</h3>
<p>Tedrick Fong returned to share his experiences in SGS, SAF, Imperial College
(London), and the Air Force. The moment students heard he was a fellow
SGS-ian, the cheers were deafening. And Tedrick? The first thing he asked
was, “Are my teachers who taught me still here?”</p>

<h4>Gems to Remember:</h4>
<p>'Results will get you to the door, but it’s your qualities—and how badly
you want it—that will determine your journey.' &amp;</p>
<p>'Setbacks aren't failures, but stepping stones to growth and success.'</p>
<h4>To all SGS alumni—your stories matter.</h4>
<p>Come back, share your journey, and inspire the next generation of SGSians.
We can't wait to welcome you home.</p>
