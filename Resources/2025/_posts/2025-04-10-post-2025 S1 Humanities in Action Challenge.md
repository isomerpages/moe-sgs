<p>At this yearâ€™s S1 Humanities-in-Action Challenge, co-organised by Serangoon
Garden Secondary School and Yio Chu Kang Secondary School, students from
10 secondary schools embarked on an Amazing Race that explored Singapore's
nation-building journey through interactive stations. From discovering
our multicultural heritage, to envisioning Singapore's future, the day
was filled with learning, laughter, and collaboration. Participants gained
deeper insights into Singapore's shared values and forged new friendships
across schools, exemplifying the SG60 spirit of unity and reminding us
that our nation's continued success depends on working together as One
People.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Guest-of-Honour, Mr. Ling Khoon Chow (Superintendent,
South 1 Cluster), for gracing the event and inspiring the students!</p>
