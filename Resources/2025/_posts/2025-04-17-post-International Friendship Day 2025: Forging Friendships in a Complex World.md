<p>This year, IFD was made more special as we hosted a visit by friends from
Choi Hung Estate Catholic Secondary School, Hong Kong. Students enjoyed
learning about each other's cultures and cuisines. International students
in SGS also shared their personal journeys and reflections.</p>

<p>During recess, students were treated to interactive booths and fun games
that sparked conversations and new connections.</p>
<p>It was a meaningful celebration of friendship, diversity, and global understanding!</p>
