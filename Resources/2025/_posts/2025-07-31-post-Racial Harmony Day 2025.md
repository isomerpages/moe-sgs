<p>✨ Racial Harmony Day 2025 ✨ Theme: Our People, Our Tapestry</p>
<p>This year’s celebration was lovingly planned and carried out by our very
own Secondary 1 CCE Ambassadors! 👏 Their dedication brought colour, culture,
and connection to life in SGS. From vibrant traditional outfits to engaging
performances, the week was packed with meaningful moments:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A colourful showcase of traditional attire by students and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fun and interactive quiz on traditions and cultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craft sessions with traditional motifs like Indian kolam designs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A heartwarming skit on how different cultures celebrate the birth of a
child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beautiful dance and guzheng performances that left us in awe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A touching lesson on the meaning of our names — reminding us that every
name carries a story, a legacy, and love</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through this celebration, we were reminded that it is our People — our
stories, cultures and kindness — that make our SG and SGS Tapestry truly
beautiful as we continue to build bridges of understanding and friendship
every day! 🌟</p>
