<p>We welcomed His Excellency, Peter Storer, Austrian Ambassador to Singapore,
for an extraordinary dialogue session, as part of the EU@School 2025 programme.</p>
<p>Students engaged with Ambassador Storer on a range of issues including
climate change, sustainability, multi-lateralism, international cooperation,
and Austria-Singapore ties.</p>
<p>Thank you, Ambassador Storer, for your personable sharing of insights,
for opening up new vistas, and for encouraging SGS students to keep on
learning and exploring, and to make our world a better place together.</p>
