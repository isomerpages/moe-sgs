<p>"Together We Build" was conceived as a hands-on, intergenerational LEGO
mural project for residents of Serangoon estate to co-create a vibrant
artwork symbolising community identity and unity, during the Kampong Serangoon
National Day Carnival on 19 Jul. Sec 3 students presented residents with
a map of the Serangoon area and quizzed them on the landmarks found there.
Residents were invited to construct miniature landmarks representing Serangoonâ€™s
heritage, diversity, and shared spirit, contributing to a larger collective
mural.</p>
