<p>As we bid a fond farewell to our Class of 2025 and as they thank ‘their
teachers, parents, and friends’ for ‘their patience, guidance, and encouragement’,
we wish them all the best in their upcoming national examinations and their
future endeavours. We would also like to thank parents and community well-wishers,
for their unwavering support for our students. It really takes a whole
Village to grow each child!</p>
