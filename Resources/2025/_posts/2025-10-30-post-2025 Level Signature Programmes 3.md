<p>Our Sec 1 students embarked on a thrilling 3D2N adventure at Sarimbun
Scout Camp, where they discovered their strengths, built lasting friendships,
and grew as resilient leaders. From high elements and water challenges
to outdoor cooking and campfire, every moment was a chance to explore,
connect, and celebrate. Through teamwork, grit , and heart, they enjoyed
the camaraderie and learned to thrive in real-world settings. This wasn’t
just a camp—it was a journey of self-discovery, courage, character and
friendships.</p>

<p>Our Sec 2 students embarked on a journey of discovery and connection through
their Level Signature Programme. From exploring the wonders of science
at the Science Centre and Oceanarium, to racing for sustainability at Gardens
by the Bay, and strengthening teamwork through inter-class games and the
ALP Oracy Programme — they demonstrated curiosity, courage and compassion.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, our students built stronger bonds with their
peers, deepened their understanding of the world around them, and discovered
their strengths, emerging as Learners with GRIT and Leaders with HEART</p>

<p>Our Sec 3s embarked on an exciting week of discovery and action. From
exploring sustainability challenges to hands-on VIA projects, and learning
journeys to the polytechnics, students deepened their understanding of
themselves, the community, and future pathways. The Aesthetics Programme
inspired creative expression and teamwork, while each experience encouraged
them to step up as active citizens, to care, create, and contribute. Together,
they discovered their passions, applied their learning in authentic contexts,
and celebrated growth in mind, heart, and spirit.</p>
