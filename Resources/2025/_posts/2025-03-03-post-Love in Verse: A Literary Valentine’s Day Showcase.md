<p>On Valentine’s Day, students in the Advanced Literature programme showcased
lively literary spark, in the spirit of the occasion. From heartfelt poetry
recitals of original sonnets penned by the students, to a skit inspired
by Carol Ann Duffy's 'Valentine', it was an afternoon filled with creativity,
inspiration, and love.</p>
