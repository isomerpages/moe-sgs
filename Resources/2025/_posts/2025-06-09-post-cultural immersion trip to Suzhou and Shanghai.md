<p>From 26 to 29 May, 30 Secondary 3 students embarked on a cultural immersion
trip to Suzhou and Shanghai. In Suzhou, students experienced a typical
school day at Pingjiang Middle School, visited the Suzhou Industrial Park
and historic sites like Master of the Nets Garden and Shantang Street,
enjoyed Suzhou’s Pingtan performance, and explored the silk industry. In
Shanghai, they learnt about urban development concepts at the Shanghai
Urban Planning Exhibition Centre, explored Xintiandi, Tianzifang, and the
Oriental Pearl Tower, wrapping up their last evening with the ERA ‘Intersection
of Time Acrobatics Show’. The trip developed students’ global awareness
and cross-cultural skills and they returned, brimming with memories of
their exciting experiences.</p>
