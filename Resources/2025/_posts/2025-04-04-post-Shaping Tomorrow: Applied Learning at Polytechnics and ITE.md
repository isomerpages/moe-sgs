<p>Upper Sec students enjoyed hands-on learning as part of Applied Learning
Modules. At Nanyang Polytechnic, students honed computational thinking
skills for tackling digital tasks; at Temasek Polytechnic, they explored
the magic of 3D printing and mechatronics. Students at ITE Colleges explored
website design, 2D-games creation, cybersecurity, and digital marketing.</p>
<p>Through these immersive experiences, students gain a greater awareness
of post-secondary pathways, and are empowered with 21st-century competencies!</p>
