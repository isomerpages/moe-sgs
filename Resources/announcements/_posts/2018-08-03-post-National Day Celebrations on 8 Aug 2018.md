Dear parents/guardians,

To celebrate National Day on 8 August 2018, your child/ward is encouraged to come to school in a red or white top and jeans, bermudas, skirt or pants. Your child/ward will be dismissed at 1 pm as our school will be celebrating that day with a student-initiated SGS Carnival.
