The school will be celebrating Teachersâ€™ Day on 5 September 2019 (Thursday) to recognise the role that teachers play in developing and inspiring students.

All students will need to report to school by 0740 in their PE attire and will be dismissed at 1115.

We wish all students a meaningful Term 3 holidays ahead.
