Dear Parent/Guardian

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to seek a transfer out of our school for your P6 child/ward, who had just received his/her secondary school posting in 2021, based on the following serious medical conditions, please contact the school at 6288 9227. </p>

**a. Serious Medical Conditions.**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students with persistent or serious illness e.g. chronic heart conditions, kidney problems. An official letter from a certified doctor must be attached to the application. </p>

**b. Severe Physical Impairments**.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students with physical impairments. An assessment from qualified medical professional(s) of the student’s conditions and needs should be submitted. The assessment should clearly describe the extent of impairments (temporary/permanent) and the type of assistive device that the student is currently using (e.g. those requiring permanent use of a wheelchair).</p>

Thank you.
