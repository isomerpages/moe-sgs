Dear SGSians,

<p style="text-align: justify;">we are delighted to have you back on Mon, 27 June 2022 as school reopens for the academic Term 3, 2022. Do note that you are to report to your respective venues (Hall for Lower Sec and Form Class for Upper Sec) by 7.50am in your SECOND school uniform â€“ ie: white top and blue bottom with a proper haircut, without coloured hair and approved footwear. Do bring a thermometer. Should you be unwell, please see a doctor.</p>

Thank you.
