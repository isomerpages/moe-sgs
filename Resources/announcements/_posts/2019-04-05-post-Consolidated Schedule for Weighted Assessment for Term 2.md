Dear Parent(s)/Guardian,

1\. Please refer to the attached consolidated schedule of Weighted Assessments (WA) for your child/ ward for Term 2 (Annex 1). The same information will also be published through Parent Gateway**\***

2\. It is important that your child/ ward is punctual for the WAs which will commence immediately after morning assembly. No extra time will be given for latecomers.

3\. Students who are absent must submit a medical certificate to their Form Teacher once they return to school. MCs issued by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners and letters from parents/ guardian will not be accepted. Students who do not submit a medical certificate will not be awarded any marks.

4\. If you require any further clarifications regarding the Weighted Assessments, please feel free to contact me at 62889227 or sgs\_parents@moe.edu.sg.

5\. Thank you for your strong partnership with the school on your child/ward’s learning programmes.
