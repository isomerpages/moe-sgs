Dear Parent/Guardian,

Edusave Awards are given by the government annually to Singaporean students to enhance educational opportunities and motivate students to excel in schools in academic and non-academic domains. The three broad categories of Edusave Awards are detailed in the four official languages ([English](/files/Announcement/Edusave%20Awards/Secondary_Eng.pdf), [Mandarin](/files/Announcement/Edusave%20Awards/Secondary_Chi.pdf), [Malay](/files/Announcement/Edusave%20Awards/Secondary_ML.pdf), [Tamil](/files/Announcement/Edusave%20Awards/Secondary_TL.pdf)).
