From April 2020, all MOE schools will implement one day of Home-Based Learning (HBL) a week. This will help us prepare for an extended period of HBL should the need arise, so that our students can continue with their learning. Our school will be conducting HBL on Thursdays starting from 2 April 2020. In the event that the day of HBL falls on a public holiday, your child/ward will not need to make up for HBL on another day. Classroom lessons will still proceed as usual on the other days of the week.

Your child/ward will be provided with instructions on how to access their HBL materials by his/her teachers. The HBL timetable for Thursday, 2 April can be found below.

If your child/ward requires additional support for HBL such as access to digital devices or internet connection, please alert his/her form teacher, who will be able to advise on alternative arrangements. On this note, the schoolâ€™s Computer Lab 1 and 2 will be open from 8.00am to 3.00pm on that day to support students who need access to digital devices or internet connection.
