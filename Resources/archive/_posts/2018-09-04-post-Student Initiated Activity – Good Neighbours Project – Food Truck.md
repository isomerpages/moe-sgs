Student Initiated Activity (SGSS)  
(Good Neighbours Project – Food Truck)

Serangoon Garden Secondary School (SGSS) has always actively created platforms for our students to exercise their voice while developing a sense of advocacy. Since 2016, the school has been involved in the Good Neighbours Project\*, which won the team the most outstanding youth project award recently. The involvement in the project was initiated by a group of students who wanted to promote neighbourliness and revive the Kampong Spirit in the Serangoon Community. The project saw our students raising the awareness of healthy eating through a Food Truck to distribute healthy salads as well as a community sandwich making competition reaching out to close to 900 residents.
