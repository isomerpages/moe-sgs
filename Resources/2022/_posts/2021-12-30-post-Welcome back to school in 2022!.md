Dear SGSians,

we are delighted to have you back on Tuesday, 4 Jan 2022 as school reopens for the academic year of 2022. Do note that you are to report to your respective classrooms by 7.55am in your SECOND school uniform â€“ ie: white top and blue bottom with a proper haircut, without coloured hair and approved footwear. Do bring a thermometer. Should you be unwell, please see a doctor. Thank you.
