Dear SGSians,

we are delighted to have you back on Tues, 3 Jan 2023 as school reopens for the Academic Year 2023. Do note that you are to report to the school hall by 7.50am in your FIRST/SECOND school uniform â€“ ie: white top and blue bottom with a proper haircut, without coloured hair and approved footwear. (Sec 1s to report to the Parade Square.)

Do bring a thermometer. Should you be unwell and please visit a doctor.

Thank you.
