<p style="text-align: justify;"> Serangoon Garden Secondary School’s (SGS) Uniformed Group student cadets have done us proud in leading the community to commemorate our nation’s 53rd birthday. On 9th August this year, the annual National Day Observance Ceremony was held at the open field beside the Serangoon Community Park located in Serangoon Avenue 4. In collaboration with the Serangoon Grassroots Organisations, 24 student cadets from SGS Uniformed Groups led residents of Aljunied GRC in the ceremonial conduct of the singing of the national anthem and reciting of the pledge. In addition, some 30 Student Councillors and Inspirational Leaders helped distribute healthy sandwiches to the participants. The sandwiches were sponsored by HDB, to encourage residents to adopt healthy lifestyles. Our students also manned a stall where residents pedalled a bicycle to generate energy to blend their own fruit juice. The Guest-of-Honour was Ms Chan Hui Yuh, Pingat Bakti Masyarakat, Adviser to Serangoon Grassroots Organisations. The event provided our students the opportunity to hone their leadership and organisational skills. They also learnt how to better communicate effectively with people from all walks of life while living out the school values of respect and empathy.</p>
