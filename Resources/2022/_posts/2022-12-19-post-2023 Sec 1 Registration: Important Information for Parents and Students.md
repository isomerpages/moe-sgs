From Mon, 9 Jan (Week 2) onwards, usual dismissal time is at **2 pm** from **Mondays** to **Thursdays** and at **12.40 pm** on **Fridays**.

Sec 1 students would be informed of their **form class** and **classroom venue** by **Friday, 30 December 2022**, via Parents Gateway. They will also receive their time-table on the first day of school, **Tue, 3 January 2023**, and are **not** required to bring textbooks for Orientation Week. They are, however, required to bring their **thermometer, stationery and water bottle** daily.

All students are strongly encouraged to have breakfast daily before attending school. In addition to **recess time**, Sec 1 students are allowed to consume a **snack** during class, at **12.20 pm**. Examples of a healthy snack which students can prepare are a whole meal sandwich, bun, fruits, nuts or a healthy snack bar. Sweets, chocolates and any form of chips/crackers are not encouraged. We seek your understanding that a small portion of food will be sufficient as the students will be having their snack in class while the lessons are in session.

###### **Section J: School Attire and General Appearance**

 Sec 1 students are to report in their school uniform on the first day of school.

Due to possible delivery delays for uniforms purchased online during the festive season, Sec 1 students may report to school in their Primary School uniform during the first 2 weeks of school.  

For more information on school attire and general appearance, please refer to [here](/students/Student-Handbook/School-Rules/)
