Dear SGSians,

<p style="text-align: justify;"> we are delighted to have you back on Mon, 21 Mar 2022 as school reopens for the academic Term 2, 2022. Do note that you are to report to your respective classrooms by 7.50am in your SECOND school uniform â€“ ie: white top and blue bottom with a proper haircut, without coloured hair and approved footwear. Do bring a thermometer. Should you be unwell, please see a doctor.</p>

Thank you.
