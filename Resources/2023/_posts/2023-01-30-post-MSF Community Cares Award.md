##### **Achievement**

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was indeed an honour for our school to be part of the 46 individuals and organisations who received the **Community Cares Award** at the MSF Volunteer and Partner Awards 2023 ceremony yesterday night. The MSF Community Cares Awards was introduced in 2019 to recognise and appreciate organisations and individuals who passionately drive social change, strive to do good for society, and in so doing, inspire those around them.
	

<p style="text-align: justify;">This could not have been possible without the concerted efforts of our teachers, AED Team, SDT Team and the support of SLs. This award is a testament to the 'heart' work that we do with our students with the underlying philosophy of us as a caring school. We believe in never leaving any child behind, regardless of their starting point in life, which may hinder their progress from attending school regularly or even regulating their emotions in school.
	
<p style="text-align: justify;">This award is a testament of all of us in having **HOPE in our students** and being true to **MOE's mission** of moulding the future of our nation.
	
<p style="text-align: justify;">For us in SGSS, we tap on every opportunity to work with partners to UPLIFT the underprivileged students in our school. Schools alone can't do much with our limited resources. We need partners who will want to walk our cause together.
	
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finding a solution for a student who does not come to school may not be an easy task to find a solution, if we work alone with the student. The family's situation could be a contributing factor for a child's absence or behavioural issues. Thus, we need community partners - such as MSF's ComLink/SSOs. With the many helping hands approach, we not only UPLIFT the child, but we also help the entire family out of the situations that may hinder a child from coming to school or presenting other issues that may impede his/her progress.
	
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2022, we started partnering with ComLink, where we referred our identified high-needs students for their **befriending porogramme**. These student's families received holistic support from ComLink befrienders, in the following areas.
	
*   Financial
*   Food
*   Employment
*   Health
*   Shelter/House matters
*   Social & Emotional
	
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you teachers for always being there for the “The Last, the Least, and the Lost”. Definitely our collective effort will bring the best in every child for them to contribute their part and maintain the unique social fabric of Singapore in moving forward.
