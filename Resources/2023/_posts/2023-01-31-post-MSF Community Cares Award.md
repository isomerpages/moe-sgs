<p style="text-align: justify;">It was indeed an honour for our school to be part of the 46 individuals and organisations who received the Community Cares Award at the MSF Volunteer and Partner Awards 2023 ceremony. The MSF Community Cares Awards was introduced in 2019 to recognise and appreciate organisations and individuals who passionately drive social change, strive to do good for society, and in so doing, inspire those around them.</p>
	
<p style="text-align: justify;">This could not have been possible without the concerted efforts of all our teachers, parents and partners. This award is a testament to the 'heart' work that we do with our students with the underlying philosophy of us as a caring school. We believe in never leaving any child behind. This award also attest to all of us having HOPE in our students and being true to MOE's mission of moulding the future of our nation.</p>
	
<p style="text-align: justify;">Definitely our collective effort will bring the best in every child for them to contribute their part and maintain the unique social fabric of Singapore in moving forward.</p>
