Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)
-------------------------------------

<p style="text-align: justify;">Full SBB is part of MOEâ€™s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Full SBB was implemented in 28 secondary schools from 2020. It is being progressively rolled out to more secondary schools each year from 2022 to 2024.</p>
