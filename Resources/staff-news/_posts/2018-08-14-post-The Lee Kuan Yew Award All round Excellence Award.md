Serangoon Garden Secondary School’s First Lee Kuan Yew All-Round Excellence Award Winner On 14 August 2018, Noel Lim from 4A1, from the school’s 2017 cohort, was awarded the Lee Kuan Yew All-Round Excellence Award. We are so proud of Noel and wish him all the best for his future endeavours. Congratulations also to all the teachers who have supported Noel on his journey – it takes a village to raise a child! An Open Letter from Lee Kuan Yew All-Round Excellence Winner, Noel Lim (4A1, 2017) Seeing my failures in primary school, I would never have thought I could come this far. I failed every test in school including my PSLE, scoring a T-score of 133 and I had lost all hope. Joining Serangoon Garden Secondary School as a Secondary 1 Normal Technical student, I was told by my teachers that if I did well, I would be promoted to the Normal Academic stream. However, I was playful, reluctant and did not want to study. In Secondary 2NT, I knew that it was my last chance to go to the NA stream. I spent my time consulting my teachers on academic matters and took more initiative in my Co-Curriculum Activity, the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC). These helped improve my confidence and social skills. I managed to be promoted to Secondary 2 NA that year. I struggled with subjects that I had never heard of nor worked on before. Despite those challenges, with perseverance, amazing teachers, NPCC as well as the Student Council, I continued my journey in SGS with a positive attitude, achieving 8 points for my GCE ‘N’ Levels. I felt extremely honoured and humbled to have been nominated for the SPF-NPCC award, the Halogen National Young Leader Award 2017 and the LKY All-Round Excellence Award. The progress that I have made is because of my teachers, friends, family, and NPCC who were always there for me, teaching me many valuable lessons that shaped me into the person I am today. To my juniors, appreciate all those around you and take every failure as an opportunity to learn. Remember that you are never alone, for there are many who are willing to offer help if you ask. Stay optimistic, as every failure will take you a step closer towards success. When you do take that step, never get complacent and keep striving for more. Never say it’s the end. All the best in your future endeavours.
