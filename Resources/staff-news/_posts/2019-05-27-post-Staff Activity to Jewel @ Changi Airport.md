<p style="text-align: justify;"> The staff took time off from their busy schedule to bond at the newly opened Jewel@Changi. They were grouped into teams and there was a mini ‘Amazing Race’ to 5 ‘stations’ where they had to carry out simple activities like posing at the top level of Jewel with the Rain Forest Vortex in the background. After the race, the staff were free to explore the Jewel. Many chose to spend the time bonding over food. The activity was a good break from the daily busyness of school for all the staff!</p>
