<p style="text-align: justify;">The school hosted Geography teachers from our cluster to a Geography Workshop jointly organized with NIE Geography Unit. Mr Edwin Chew, Lead Teacher for Geography, shared how he brought the environment to the classroom by using a google cardboard virtual reality (VR) kit. Participants learnt to assemble the VR kit with the help of one of our students. The workshop also included a sharing by an NIE lecturer on Geography assessment.</p>
