<p style="text-align: justify;"> The staff had their Teachers’ Day Celebration at the Furama Riverfront Hotel on 29 August. The theme for the lunch was ‘Balik Kampong’ and many staff were dressed according to the theme. Ms Esther Yong, Miss Eunice Yeo, Ms Chew Kai Qing and Miss Angela Ho came dressed as samsui women and won the best dressed competition. As it is a normal practice, the new staff who joint SGS in 2018, including the School Leaders, had to put up a performance. The School Advisory Committee (SAC) also graced the occasion and participated in the activities. </p>
