<p style="text-align: justify;">Staff Well Being Committee oganised the annual Chinese New Year shopping trip to Chinatown for staff on 8/1/20. Our staff had a wonderful afternoon of bonding through food and retail therapy. Most of us went for desert at the famous desert shop at Temple Street followed by shopping at the nearby street market for snacks such as peanuts, jellies, sweets and flowers. Another group of teachers went for Mala Xiang Guo as they love spicy food. Overall, it was an enjoyable afternoon for our SGS staff as we prep ourselves for the festive session and the semester ahead! </p>
