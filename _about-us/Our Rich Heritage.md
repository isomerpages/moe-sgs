<p>Serangoon Garden Secondary School began as Lichfield Secondary School,
an English-medium school, in 1959. &nbsp;In the following year, the school
was renamed Serangoon Garden Government High School, an integrated school
that offered both English and Chinese streams. &nbsp;In 1969, the school
merged with neighbouring Hwi Yoh Vocational School, and Serangoon Garden
Secondary School was established.&nbsp; With this merger, the school expanded
its range of facilities and was able to offer academic, technical, and
commercial subjects for its students.</p>

<p>In 1965, the school was designated as a Pre-University Centre and offered
pre-university Arts and Science courses till 1974. &nbsp;In 1976, the school
saw its highest enrolment ever of 3000 students and 78 classes.&nbsp; That
same year, it officially adopted the school motto <em>Integrity and Diligence</em>.&nbsp;
The three-year Pre-University course was re-introduced from 1980 to 1991.
&nbsp;In 1984, the school became an English-medium school with the last
batch of Chinese-stream students graduating in the same year.</p>

<p>In 2003, Serangoon Garden Secondary School merged with Serangoon Garden
Technical School to form the present school. &nbsp;Serangoon Garden Technical
School was officially opened by the then Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
on 18 July, 1964. &nbsp;Located at Burghley Drive in the Serangoon Garden
estate, the school offered technical and academic classes in two language
streams, English and Chinese. &nbsp;In 1973, when the centralised scheme
for technical education was introduced, students from nearby schools attended
lessons for technical subjects at Serangoon Garden Technical School.</p>
