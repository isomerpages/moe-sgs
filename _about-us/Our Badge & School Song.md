Go forth! Our Blazing torch uphold  
With friendships true and hearts of gold.  
Let’s learn with grace and serve with pride.  
Let faith and wisdom be our guide.

Nor creed nor race, both young and old  
United in our motto bold –  
With diligence and integrity,  
We’ll shine our light for all to see.  
Forge on with all our zeal and might:  
Serangoon Garden flame, burn bright!
