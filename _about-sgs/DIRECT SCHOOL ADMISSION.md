**About Direct School Admission (DSA-Sec)**

Under the Direct School Admission Secondary (DSA-Sec) exercise, secondary schools may offer Secondary 1 places to suitable primary students earlier, using school-based criteria other than PSLE results. These criteria are schools-based and seek to allow a greater range of student achievements and talents to be recognised.

Students successfully allocated to their DSA-Schools will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOT</strong></span> be allowed to participate in the annual S1 Posting Exercise to opt for secondary schools, and are expected to honour the commitment to the allocated DSA-Sec school **and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.**

They will also <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOT</strong></span> be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results

Interested students may also refer to some MOE Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for more information on the DSA-Sec Exercise, or call the MOE Customer Service Centre at 6872-2220.
