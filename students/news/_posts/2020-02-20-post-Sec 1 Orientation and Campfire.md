<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Secondary One Orientation was held on 2nd and 3rd January 2020. Through the various activities conducted by the Student Council and CCA Leaders, the Secondary One students had the opportunities to learn more about the school culture and environment, get a glimpse of the programmes offered by the school (such as CCA, ALP etc), as well as getting to know their new classmates and teachers. The orientation was concluded with our SGS highlight and tradition, campfire night. Students took turn to put performances and sang campfire songs to celebrate their new found friendship and joining the SGS family. </p>
