##### A. Entry requirements and Administrative details.

1. <strong><u> What is the school’s indicative PSLE score range?</u></strong>

|                  | Indicative Score Range |
|:----------------:|:----------------------:|
|      Express     |         8 – 22         |
|  Normal Academic |         21 – 25        |
| Normal Technical |         25 – 28        |

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The PSLE score ranges are indicative as 2021 is the first year of transition from T-score to Achievement Levels (AL) scoring system. They are simulated using the 2020 PSLE cohort results and students’ school choice. </p>

2.  **Can we still appeal if my child does not get posted to SGS?**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, you may still appeal. However, we are unable to guarantee whether the appeal will be successful, as the indicative score may change depending on the demand for places in our school. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Given that we have seen an increase in demand for places in SGS over the past few years, you may wish to consider opting for SGS as one of the first 3 choices to avoid having to go through an appeal to enrol with us.</p>
