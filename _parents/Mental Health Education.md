Serangoon Garden’s Mental Health Education (MHE) Programme is designed to achieve the following goals for our students, as defined by MOE’s Student Development Curriculum Division (SCDC). It aims to:

*   **G1:** Strengthen students’ resilience and well-being for good mental health
*   **G2:** Guide students to understand mental health as a continuum (mental wellness to mental illness)
*   **G3:** Develop in students an understanding of mental illness and their treatments
*   **G4:** Enhance students’ help-seeking efficacy 
*   **G5:** Destigmatise mental illnessfor our students

In line with the goals stated above, the MHE curriculum in Serangoon Garden Secondary School has developed and customised a series of programmes for our students. The table below states the range of topics covered in the MHE curriculum from Sec 1 to 4, outlining the Skills, Knowledge, Values and Attitude which will be covered in the various aspects of your child’s school experiences- including FT Periods, CCE lessons, assembly programmes and Level Signature Programmes.
