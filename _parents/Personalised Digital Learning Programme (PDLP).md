<h3>National Digital Literacy Programme</h3>
<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen
their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction
of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary
school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed
Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.</p>
<h3>Personal Learning Device</h3>
<p>Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) will truly transform the learning environment
as it allows teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness
in teaching and learning. The use of the personal learning devices for
teaching and learning will support the development of digital literacies
in our students as well as develop them as self-directed and collaborative
learners.</p>
<p>SGS has selected the Acer TravelMate Spin B3 as its PLD offering . Despite
its small size, it is feature packed with a responsive 11.6″ touchscreen
and upgraded components like its CPU, RAM and storage. With 3 years of
warranty and insurance coverage, it offers superb value for money and will
provide students with many good years of learning and productivity.</p>

<h3>Financial Assistance</h3>
<p>Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase
a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial
Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for any remaining sums
due for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. Please see the table
