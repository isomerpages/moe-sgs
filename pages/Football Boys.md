<p style="text-align: justify;"> Football at SGSS has a rich and long history. SGSS was where national football icon, Fandi Ahmad, played in the 1970s. Many of the SGSS footballers graduated and eventually made it to the Singapore Premier League and the Singapore national team over the years. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The SGSS Football team has been competing and achieving success at both the Zonal and National tournaments. Despite COVID 19, the boys have continued training regularly, both online and physically. This has helped to keep the players physically, technically and tactically sharp. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> As the CCA (and the rest of Singapore) emerges from the COVID pandemic and re-starts the regular physical sessions and competitions, we look forward to the exciting road ahead for SGSS football. </p>
