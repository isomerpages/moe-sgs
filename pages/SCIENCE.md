The SGS Science department aims to inculcate in our students a strong interest and joy in the learning of Science, nurture positive scientific values and attitudes by providing varied, authentic, relevant and real-world learning experiences so as to nurture effective and competent contributors. We strive to enable our students to seek data and information to validate observations of phenomena with a scientific mindset and inquiring mind, to understand scientific applications in the real world.

Science Learning Day includes a wide array of authentic learning experiences to engage our students in the exploration of Science beyond their classrooms and books, including laboratory based workshops, digital making and collaborations with external partners e.g. Science Centre Singapore, polytechnics, NUS, NTU, EMA and NParks.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Hydroponics Research Programme focuses on connecting students’ knowledge learnt in school to solve real-world issues such as food security problems through Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). It also aims to develop learning dispositions such as resilience and adaptability when conducting their research. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> As part of the Hydroponics Enrichment Programme, the Science department collaborated with the school’s CCE ambassadors in our Be-. Up- project. The project involved the growing of sweet Thai basil plants in our Hydroponics greenhouse, with the aim of promoting awareness of urban farming and sustainable living. The Teachers’ Day cards, personalized bookmark/ nametag, and cards designed with the laminated basil leaves aim to celebrate all SGS staff who dedicatedly brave the rain or shine each day to shelter and nurture the seeds of the future. “The flowers that bloom tomorrow are the seeds that we plant today.” </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Young Explorers’ Experiment Toolkit (YEET) project was designed to encourage self-directed learning in students, sparking curiosity and imbue the joy of learning in Science through simple DIY experiments at home, and virtual explorations/tours beyond the classroom and laboratory lessons. Leveraging on the students’ PLDs, Google Classroom was used for its implementation and administration. For instance, e-booklets were used instead of the printed physical copies of the programme booklets, thus reinforcing the school’s green initiatives and efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Advanced Elective Modules (AEMs), a collaboration with the polytechnics provides students with opportunities to make sense of, and apply knowledge to authentic, relevant learning contexts and to help them discover their strengths and interests. Participation in AEMs also serve to strengthen the students’ portfolios through enhanced learning experiences. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> To increase our students’ exposure to learning opportunities beyond the school, the department provides opportunities for students to participate in external competitions. An example is the annual GMAC Challenge organized by the Genetic Modification Advisory Committee. Participants are tasked to create an infographic poster based on various GM themes with the aim of promoting active learning and stimulating students’ interest in Science-based GM-related topics. </p>
