<p style="text-align: justify;"> 2017 was a breakthrough year for the Language Arts Club as we took to the stage for the first time at the Singapore Youth Festival. While our hearts were filled with trepidation, we nonetheless gamely tackled Kuo Pao Kun’s classic play, Mama Looking For Her Cat – a heart-wrenching tale of how a dysfunctional Singaporean family comes to grips with its matriarch’s loneliness. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> A gamut of our most talented students ranging from Sec 1 to 4 took part in preparing for their roles onstage and off-stage, making it a truly united LAC effort, which all paid off when we clinched the Certificate of Accomplishment. In addition, we also took part in the National Schools Literature Festival, fielding two teams of Lower Secondary students for the Lower Secondary Book Trailer and Choral Speaking competitions, allowing the students to gain valuable public performance exposure. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> We wrapped things off for the year with a Teachers’ Day segment, where we hosted a rip-roaring pop quiz for the crowd. We look forward to every new year and its challenges with great gusto. Let us continue to entertain you! </p>

##### **Online Co-curricular activities (_CCA_)**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The opportunity for the pupils of the Language Arts Club to come together to rehearse is no longer made possible in view of the COVID-19 situation. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Nevertheless, this did not deter the teachers-in-charge and pupils to meet one another, to rehearse.  Instead of the physical meet-up, the pupils met online to rehearse for the upcoming National Day celebration.  Each pupil, with guidance from the teachers-in-charge, rehearsed on their roles, in the comfort of their homes.  The individual recordings were later pieced together into a presentation. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Language Arts Club is therefore proud to present a snippet of its first production on zoom for our upcoming National Day’s celebration. This theatre performance touches on many relatable issues we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic. Enjoy the video. </p>
