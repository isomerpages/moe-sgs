<p>SGS had the pleasure of hosting students and teachers from Choi Hung Estate
Catholic Secondary School as part of our International Friendship Day celebrations
on 11 April 2025, Friday.</p>
<p>The day began with our visitors participating in a special concert following
the morning assembly. They also delivered a PowerPoint presentation introducing
their school, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), and academic experiences.</p>
<p>Following the celebration, our overseas guests had the opportunity to
attend Secondary 2 and 3 classes, where they actively engaged in various
lessons. &nbsp;Each visitor was paired with an SGS buddy, who supported
them by explaining lesson content and helping them feel at ease in a new
classroom environment.</p>
<p>A highlight of the exchange programme was a hands-on Food and Consumer
Education (FCE) lesson. Together with their SGS buddies, our guests prepared
Pad Thai, a beloved Thai dish. The activity was not only educational but
also incredibly enjoyable, with everyone taking pride in the delicious
food they created.</p>
<p>This meaningful exchange provided an excellent platform for our students
to enhance their communication and hosting skills. &nbsp;It also boosted
their confidence as they interacted with peers from Hong Kong, fostering
cross-cultural friendships and understanding.</p>
