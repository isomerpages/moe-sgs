<p style="text-align: justify;"> The SGS Guzheng Ensemble nurtures in students a deep appreciation for the traditional Chinese instrument. In the Ensemble, students are encouraged to demonstrate values of perseverance and diligence as they work together as a team to train their coordination, focus and musicality. </p>


		 
##### **Key programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Members have many opportunities to perform during school events like the Chinese New Year Celebrations, Garden Fiesta and Teachers’ Day Celebration. We have also performed at Serangoon National Day Dinner, The French School and NEX shopping mall. In addition, students participate in combined schools concerts that serve as platforms for them to meet like-minded friends with a common interest in traditional Chinese music and to hone their playing skills. These experiences also help build performance experience and stage confidence in our students. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The ensemble gives back to school and community through our VIA programme. In 2022, the ensemble created a wall mural in our school to spread the love for music. Our students led, planned and designed the wall mural painted besides the school’s music room. </p>
		 
##### **Our Achievements**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Under the guidance of our instructor, Ms Zhang Rong Hui, our ensemble took part in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation and achieved a Certificate of Distinction from 2013 to 2021. The stellar results are made possible through our consistent effort and team work. </p>
