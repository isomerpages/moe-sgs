##### **WALKING**

1) Crossing at traffic junctions or pedestrian crossings:

*   Refrain from using mobile phones or other electronic audio devices when crossing
*   Stop, look right, look left, and then look right again
*   Wait for vehicles to come to a complete STOP before crossing
*   Raise hand to attract the attention of drivers when crossing
*   Cross briskly and observe oncoming traffic
*   Cross at designated routes such as zebra crossings and at traffic lights at all times and at the school vicinity.

2) Use footpaths and overhead bridges and do not cross at dangerous corners and intersections.

3) Use pavements and avoid walking on the road.

4) At bus stops, do not cross immediately in front of buses after alighting.

5) Obey school patrol wardens and police.

6) Wear light-coloured clothing at night.

##### **TRAVELLING BY PUBLIC BUS**

1) Keep off bus bays.

2) Flag the bus early.

3) Queue up and board the bus in an orderly manner.

4) Press the bell early to alert the driver you wish to alight.

5) Observe proper behaviour and decorum in the bus.

##### **CYCLING**

1) When using a public road, all bicycle riders must obey the same rules as other vehicles. A cyclist may be punished under the Penal Code/Road Traffic Act should he/she act rashly or negligently so as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others.

2) Cyclists shall not unreasonably obstruct or prevent free passage of a vehicle or pedestrian upon a path or road. Cycling abreast is prohibited.

3) Bicycles are not permitted to be towed by any other vehicle when on the road.

4) No pillion passenger shall be carried on a bicycle unless it is designed to do so. Cyclists are advised to wear helmets.

5) A child under 12 years of age may be carried on a properly constructed child seat affixed firmly to the bicycle.

6) Bicycles are not allowed to be ridden where bicycle riding is prohibited e.g. expressways, road tunnels and areas demarcated with prohibitive signs.

7) Do not cycle across overhead pedestrian bridges or pedestrian crossings. Dismount and push your bicycle and practise proper kerb drills before crossing the road. Bicycles must be parked at the designated parking lots.

8) Always use the correct hand signals when turning left or right or stopping. Make them in sufficient time to enable other motorists to take appropriate action.

9) To be more visible to drivers, cyclists are strongly recommended to use blinking lights when cycling especially in the early morning and at night; white for the front and red for the rear.

10) If not on the pedestrian walkway, cyclists must use the route responsibly and not endanger pedestrians.
