##### **Vision**

Extraordinary Youth Leaders

##### **Mission**

To Nurture Inspiring Leaders and Committed Citizens through Fun, Adventurous and Military-Related Activities

Leadership, Fitness and Commitment to Singapore

**"Cadet Strong" Framework:** A resilient mind, fit body and committed heart and a self-motivated leader

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The CCA provides a holistic education for our cadets and serves as a platform for character building. Cadets will learn basic military skills training such as foot and arms drill, physical training and individual field craft. Cadets will get an opportunity to attend leadership courses during the course of 4 to 5 years of their education period. Cadets who have completed their course of service will be more prepared for Basic Military Training. This will help to ease the process when they enlist into National Service in the near future. Through the school weekly training and programmes offered, the cadets are able to hone their leadership qualities, build rapport and trust and strengthen the camaraderie.
	
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Some of the NCC core values such as Leadership, Discipline and Adventurous spirit are inculcated in our cadets through the various programmes offered by school and HQNCC.
