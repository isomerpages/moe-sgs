<p style="text-align: justify;"> At Serangoon Garden Secondary School, we believe in educating students to enjoy and appreciate living active and healthy lifestyles through a Physical Education programme that is engaging and varied. We teach a variety of sports over the four to five years at SGS, namely, table tennis, floorball, basketball, badminton, football, volleyball and softball, netball. On top of this we introduce sports like tennis and missile-golf. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Our Outdoor Education (OE) and Physical Health & Fitness (PHF) modules teach students the fundamentals of being independent and be able to negotiate with nature and the environment such as map reading and navigation, bouldering, and learning to start fires from scratch with firewood. For PHF, we teach several areas of health and Physical Education related topics such as basic anatomy, basic first aid, and add-on topics like nutrition and hydration, which are areas that are equally important and complement one’s active lifestyle. </p>

##### **Signature Programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> At Serangoon Garden Secondary, Physical Education is not just about the play, competition, physical activity and fitness. It is about teaching the life skills that can be learnt through sports. Values such as sportsmanship, discipline, diligence, and being responsible are taught constantly as the teachers continuously facilitate and draw out these learning points at every opportunity. </p>
