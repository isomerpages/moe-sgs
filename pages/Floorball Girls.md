<p style="text-align: justify;"> We are a group of passionate Floorballers who come together, to train, learn, and grow as an individual and a team. We are proud to call ourselves ‘SGS Lions’ – a symbol of courage and strength. We are all about fun and also about being disciplined. We believe that putting in the hard work pays off!. </p>

##### **Key programmes**
<p style="text-align: justify;">The year started with the CCA Open House for the Secondary 1 cohort. We were looking forward to showcase what Floorball has to offer to our juniors. In 2022, the long-awaited NSG finally started! We geared up and got ourselves ready for the games at the beginning of the year. It was nerve-wrecking and a great opportunity for us to pit our skills against players from other schools. We carried out a number of VIA activities in 2022. We had a combined VIA event with Red Cross and Netball CCAs where the students of each CCA came together and shared our skills with one another. For instance, we picked up first aid skills from our Red Cross counterparts and shared with them some Floorball techniques. </p>
