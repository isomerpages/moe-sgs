<p>Dear Parent(s)/Guardian,</p>
<p>If you wish to seek a transfer out of our school for your P6 child/ward,
who had just received his/her secondary school posting for 2025, due to
the following serious medical conditions, please contact the school at
6288 9227 and request to speak with Ms Tay Hui Yih, Lower Sec Year Head.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Serious Medical Conditions. </strong>This
applies to students with persistent or serious illnesses (e.g., chronic
heart conditions, kidney problems). An official letter from a certified
doctor must be attached to the application.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Severe Physical Impairments</strong>.
This applies to students with physical impairments. An assessment from
qualified medical professional(s) detailing the studentâ€™s conditions and
needs should be submitted. The assessment should clearly describe the extent
of the impairments (temporary or permanent) and specify any assistive devices
the student is using (e.g., those requiring permanent use of a wheelchair).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
