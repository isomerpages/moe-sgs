<p><strong>2026 Sec 1 Registration: Medical Appeal Exercise (MAE) – Monday, 22 December 2025, 8.30 am to 12 pm</strong>
</p>
<p>Dear Parent(s)/Guardian,</p>
<p>If you wish to seek a transfer out of our school for your P6 child/ward,
who had just received his/her secondary school posting, due to the following
serious medical conditions, please contact the school at 6288 9227 and
request to speak with Ms Tay Hui Yih, Year Head (Lower Sec) or Ms Lim Wan
Qi, Assistant Year Head (Lower Sec).</p>
<p>a.	<strong>Serious Medical Conditions.</strong> This applies to students
with persistent or serious illnesses (e.g., chronic heart conditions, kidney
problems). An official letter from a certified doctor must be attached
to the application.</p>
<p>b.	<strong>Severe Physical Impairments</strong>. This applies to students
with physical impairments. An assessment from qualified medical professional(s)
detailing the student’s conditions and needs should be submitted. The assessment
should clearly describe the extent of the impairments (temporary or permanent)
and specify any assistive devices the student is using (e.g., those requiring
permanent use of a wheelchair).</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
