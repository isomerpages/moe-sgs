<p style="text-align: justify;"> In the Robotics Club, students learn about and take part in activities related to aviation , coding and automation as well as other technology-related areas. Professionals or seniors will guide students in their learning. Students will represent the school in national robotic competitions. The Robotics Club focus on developing 21st-century skills in students. Students learn to innovate, communicate and collaborate with their peers. They collaborate with one another to spark creative ideas. Be critical in new endeavor's, be bold to make decisive actions. Through such the collective vision of a SMART Nation becomes viable. </p>


##### **Key programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Robotic Club represented the school in the National Robomaster Youth Technical Challenge. In the Robomaster Youth Technical Challenge, students learn valuable STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) skills. Students also take part in the National IDE maker competition. One of the team received the Design Award. All our Robotics members also represented the 3D-Tronics Competition. In the competition, students used Micro-controller kit to create a prototype to build resilience in Covid Endemic Singapore. With all the exposure, students got to showcase their skills in coding, digital making and problem solving. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Students will attend Block-based Prototyping Programming to learn basic coding and computational thinking. Exploring technology to solve simulated problems in their daily lives. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Besides competitions and workshops, the students were also involved VIA project in preparation. Students learn to identify and consider possible options in addressing social concerns. We want our students to become concerned citizens and responsible leaders. </p>
