##### **Education and Career Guidance**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Our ECG Counsellor supports students (individually or in small groups) with the necessary knowledge and skills to make informed decisions for smoother transition to further education or work. Students who would like to explore more about subject choices or ask about post-secondary education options or find out more about their career interests, strengths and passions, can have a chat with the school’s ECG Counsellor. </p>
