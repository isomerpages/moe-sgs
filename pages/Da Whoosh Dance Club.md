<p style="text-align: justify;"> “DWDC, Da Whoosh!” This is the cheer often made by the dancers of the SGS Da Whoosh Dance Club (DWDC). A close-knit team, the dancers have been building up their repertoire of Hip Hop and Modern Contemporary dance moves. As a CCA which emphasizes on student-led ideation and leadership, the dance club provides many opportunities for the dancers to choreograph different types of performances. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In 2021, our dancers competed in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), performing a modern dance piece titled “Throwback Thursday”. Both teams were accredited, with one team achieving a Certificate of Distinction and the other team, a Certificate of Accomplishment. The dancers also took part in the 2021 ActiveSG Dance Challenge, representing the school in the nationwide challenge. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The SGS dancers also perform regularly at key school events such as at the annual Chinese New Year Celebrations, National Day Celebrations and Open House. They also get to experience an inter-school dance camp at the end of every year. This gives them a great opportunity to interact with dancers from other schools, forging new friendships through dance while honing their skills. </p>

##### **CCA Training in times of COVID-19**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The pandemic has brought much inconvenience to many, whether in the area of work, school or even family time. Despite this difficult period, the students of the Dance Club did not stop meeting another, practicing on their dance skills and knowledge. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Students continue to learn and execute the dance steps online from our instructor, in the comfort of their individual homes. </p>
