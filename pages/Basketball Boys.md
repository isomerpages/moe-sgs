<p style="text-align: justify;"> The SGS Basketball team believes that CCA plays an important role in developing learners with GRIT, and leaders with heart in Serangoon Garden Secondary School. To that end, here at SGS Basketball, we aim to grow our boys in their character and their discipline, in order to be a truly championship worthy team. </p>


##### **Key programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Every year, our school basketball team will participate in the South Zone Basketball Championships and BM U-16 Basketball Championships. Our boys also undergo gym programs as part of their physical training. Through trainings and competitions, our players develop their self-confidence, perseverance to overcome the odds of winning and empathy towards their opponents. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In addition, the CCA also acts as a platform for the students to forge friendships and bond outside of the classroom environment. All of these provide opportunities for our boys to excel physically and emotionally as they participate in and grow through the Basketball programme in SGS.
