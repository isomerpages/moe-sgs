##### **National Police Cadet Corps**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The mission of the National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our cadets into active citizens and community leaders who are morally upright and law-abiding, by working in partnership with Singapore Police Force. Values such as integrity, resilience and selflessness are inculcated in our cadets through various programmes that teach them to contribute to the safety and security of our community. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Through challenging situations, cadets hone their leadership qualities, develop respect for their seniors and strengthen camaraderie with their peers. While the SGS NPCC unit has achieved many prestigious awards over the years including the Gold Award in the Best Unit Competition, Officer Commanding (OC) Mr Peh Chin Keong shared that it is seeing the cadets grow into confident young men and women which is most rewarding. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> “NPCC offers opportunities for cadets to head projects and work together with teachers and volunteers to plan and implement initiatives,” which are increasingly important in a digital world where students can easily lose the interpersonal touch and the ability to communicate effectively. It is hence important for NPCC cadets to learn through collaboration, to strive for excellence and develop a winning mindset, so as to uphold its proud tradition of producing fine young leaders for school and community. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Alongside Mr. Peh, our Unit is also ably supported by the following Teacher-Officers in charge of the various squad levels – Mr.Fareeq Othman (Sec 1 squad), Ms. Ita Pranatih (Sec 2 squad), Mr. Joel Yow (Sec 3 squad) and Mrs. Joanne Lee (Sec 4 squad). </p>

*   Unit Award – Unit Overall Proficiency Award 2019 (Gold)
*   Unit Award – Unit Overall Proficiency Award 2018 (Gold)

##### **CCA Training in times of COVID-19**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Due to Covid-19, our unit has remained nimble and successfully transformed our traditional training activities and institutionalised a hybrid blended-learning model. The teachers-in-charge of the various levels planned and implemented online technological platforms such as the NPCC Home-Based Learning Site (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/npcchbl/home">https://sites.google.com/view/npcchbl/home</a>). Student Learning Space (SLS) and Google Classroom, which are used as submission platforms for our cadets to attain their knowledge and badges. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Sec 1 cadets successfully completed the Crime Prevention (CP) online badge work under the supervision of Ms. Ita. Our cadets designed their own posters and put them up on the class noticeboards around the school to spread the crime prevention messages. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The NPCC’s ‘Police Youth Ambassador (PYA)’ and ‘Community Safety & Security Programme – Values In Action (CSSP-VIA)’ courses, involving the teachers-in-charge Mr. David Kwong and Mr. Joel Yow, and Secondary 2 and 3 cadets were virtually conducted online. For both programmes, cadets were able to deepen their awareness about SGSecure and were taught skills and knowledge to identify security threats in Singapore and around the world. Thereafter, the cadets became advocates of SGSecure by producing a video which was shared during morning assembly on a school-wide level. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The unit is thankful to Serangoon Neighbourhood Police Centre and NPCC Headquarters for providing a wide array of online resources to support our online initiative, including the recent Cybercrime Webinar, which has benefitted our cadets tremendously. </p>
