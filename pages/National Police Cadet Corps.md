<p style="text-align: justify;"> The mission of the National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our cadets into active citizens and community leaders who are morally upright and law-abiding, by working in partnership with Singapore Police Force. Values such as integrity, resilience and selflessness are inculcated in our cadets through various programmes that teach them to contribute to the safety and security of our community. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Through challenging situations, cadets hone their leadership qualities, develop respect for their seniors and strengthen camaraderie with their peers. While the SGS NPCC unit has achieved many prestigious awards over the year, what s most rewarding is seeing the cadets grow into confident young men and women, and develop into leaders of the school and community. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Alongside Officer Commanding (OC) Mr. Joel Yow, our Unit is also ably supported by the following Teacher-Officers in charge of the various squad levels – Mr Peh Chin Keong (Sec 1 squad), Mr. Fareeq Othman (Sec 2 squad), Ms. Ita Pranatih (Sec 3 squad), and Mrs. Joanne Lee (Sec 3 squad). </p>


##### **Key programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In order to inculcate the fundamental values of discipline, resilience, and respect in our cadets, our core programs for unit training include foot drills, campcraft, and physical training. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In addition to that, the cadets also embark on a host of enriching and engaging activities, organized either by the unit or by NPCC HQ. Through the curriculum, they undergo experiences that equip them with the knowledge and skills of a confident leader and active citizen. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> For our Sec 1 cadets, there is a strong focus on knowledge building, going through modules on crime prevention, police procedures, and road safety (among others). </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Our Sec 2 and 3 cadets also managed to hone their outdoor adventure skills through the Day Camp at Camp Resilience (Pulau Ubin). The cadets applied their orienteering skills to find the way from the jetty to the campsite, with the use of just a map and compass. Our Sec 3 cadets also had the opportunity to go for their .22 Revolver Dry Practice and Live Shoot, where some of them managed to earn their Marksmanship Badge.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In terms of Value-In-Action projects, our Sec 2 and 3 cadets were involved in the NPCC’s Community Safety & Security Programme (CSSP) and Police Youth Ambassador (PYA) courses respectively. Through these programs, cadets are typically tasked to ideate and organise an action plan to serve the community within and beyond the school. For example, our Sec 2s created their own video to spread the anti-bullying message, while our Sec 3 cadets collaborated with Serangoon Neighbourhood Police Post to spread awareness of e-commerce scams to residents in the area through house visits. </p>
