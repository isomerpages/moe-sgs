<p>The school year came to a rousing finish with the Semestral Awards Day
last Friday, where we celebrated students' achievements in both academic
and non-academic domains. The PRIDE Award recognises students for demonstrating
exemplary character, displaying civic responsibility and upholding our
school values through words and actions. We also celebrated students' academic
achievements, affirming the effort and hard work they put in throughout
this year. Indeed, SGS students have learnt well, served well, and led
well in 2025!</p>
<p>Let's watch the prize ceremony in the videos below!</p>
