<p><strong>About Direct School Admission (DSA-Sec)</strong>
</p>
<p>Under the Direct School Admission Secondary (DSA-Sec) exercise, secondary
schools may offer Secondary 1 places to suitable primary students earlier,
using school-based criteria other than PSLE results. These criteria are
schools-based and seek to allow a greater range of student achievements
and talents to be recognised.</p>
<p>Students successfully allocated to their DSA-Schools will <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> be
allowed to participate in the annual S1 Posting Exercise to opt for secondary
schools, and are expected to honour the commitment to the allocated DSA-Sec
school <strong>and participate in&nbsp; activities related to the talent for which they are selected from year 1 to 4.</strong>
</p>
<p>They will also <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> be allowed to transfer to another
school after the release of the PSLE results.</p>
<p>Interested students may also refer to some MOE Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQs) for more information on the DSA-Sec Exercise, or call the MOE Customer
Service Centre at 6872-2220.</p>
