## **Rationale of CCA in School**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> CCA plays a key role in the holistic development of our students. Well-organised and implemented, they will fuel in the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, skill or interest. This will subsequently help the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> CCA emphasises social interaction but each CCA has its specific objectives. Sports develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in students. The performing arts instill in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society. Uniformed group activities aim to make leaders out of students as they learn to work together building their social skills. Besides inculcating values, CCA also imbues in our students an entrepreneurial spirit, a risk-taking attitude and an appreciation for the aesthetics, all of which are necessary for the holistic development of an individual. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Good performance and participation in CCA will be considered when students apply for certain enrichment programmes, such as overseas trips. </p>

1.  Every student is expected to attend a CCA. Every student is to participate in one core CCA only. Student are strongly encouraged to go through their 4 or 5 years in their CCA. Change of CCA is made on a case by case basis such as for example, medical reasons.
2.  Students should consider their choice of CCA carefully and should select a CCA which they are interested in. This will ensure a more meaningful and enjoyable CCA learning experience for them.

#### **Safety: Guidelines for Students for Camps, Physical Activities and Overseas Trips**

*   Students should be medically and physically fit for all physical activities. If unwell, students must inform the teacher-in–charge of the activity.
*   Students and parents must inform the school and staff involved of their known medical history, such as pre-existing injuries, allergies and illnesses (e.g. asthma). Students may not participate in certain activities if they are medically unable to but are expected to attend the alternative activities planned.
*   Students who are deemed fit for physical activity after returning from long – term medical leave will need to inform their respective PE and CCA teachers. They will gradually increase the level of intensity for physical activities for 2 weeks before full resumption of physical activities when assessed to be ready.
*   Students with pre-existing medical conditions (e.g. asthma) are advised to have their prescribed medicine (e.g. inhaler) with them at all times.
*   Students are advised to have a light meal and drink sufficient water prior to attending any physical activity. Students should bring along water bottles and be hydrated regularly. There are water coolers situated in all areas of the school for re-fills.
