<p style="text-align: justify;"> “We are as strong as our weakest player” - the performance of each team member is important in a team and at SGS Concert Band, we strive to put in our best efforts to display our musical skills and perform with confidence as a team. We are a Band that strives to work hard, serve sincerely and grow together. </p>

##### **Key programmes**
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In school, we perform during Chinese New Year concert and provide support for the National Day parade segment. Beyond school, we are proud to have displayed our skills at our biennial concert – “Garden Fiesta” on 23 July 2022 at the University Cultural Centre. We also performed at the "Schools in Concert" event held on 23 November 2022 at the School of the Arts (SOTA). This concert was organized by the Band Director’s Association (BDA) to provide a platform for youths to showcase our talents in a formal concert hall setting for the general public and to gain valuable stage performance experience. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> As the pandemic restrictions eased, we also managed to continue our service to the community through the Values-In-Action (VIA) project in partnership with the Language Arts Club (LAC). We carried out an Aesthetics Appreciation Session over zoom for the Primary 1 and 2 students at Rosyth Primary, and making simple percussion instruments and delivering them to the K1 and K2 children at PCF Sparkletots, bringing them joy.
