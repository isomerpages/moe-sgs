##### **Our Belief**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> We believe in the interconnectedness of core values, citizenship dispositions, social-emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are crucial to the character and citizenship development of our students. </p>

##### **Department** **Vision**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> To nurture SGsians to be confident and self-directed learners who care for and contribute actively to their family, school and nation. </p>

##### **Department Mission**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> To develop the character of every student through providing a coherent and comprehensive CCE programme that is holistic and developmental. </p>

##### **Overview**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> To develop our students’ character, the CCE Department ensures purposeful implementation of the school’s CCE curriculum by aligning various learning experiences and curriculum lessons towards our schools’ values, distinctive programmes, students’ needs and profile. To ensure the student-centric and meaningful delivery of the CCE curriculum, we create learning environments that encourage authentic, collaborative and dialogic learning. Through this, we seek to engage students through their Head, their Heart and their Hands. </p>
		 
##### **CCE @ SGS**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The CCE curriculum in SGS includes Sexuality Education (SEd), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyberwellness (CW), and CCE Themed Lessons (MOE prescribed and school-based). We nurture our students through meaningfully designed lessons and learning experiences within the CCE curriculum. The two diagrams below summarise the purpose and outcomes of the CCE curriculum and learning experiences in SGS. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Serangoon Garden Secondary’s CCE programmes are grounded in the school’s PRIDE (Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence and Empathy) values and MOE’s R3ICH values. With the core values as its foundation, students are equipped with key citizenship dispositions, skills, knowledge, 21st CC and socio-emotional competencies (SEC) through the various meaningful curriculum lessons and learning experiences organised by the school. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> With understanding of the students’ developmental needs, profiles and unique school experiences throughout their secondary school years, the school designs purposeful and engaging programmes for them. Guided by the approach of providing dialogic learning environments for the students, strategies like Making Thinking Visible (MTV) routines and Talk Moves are adopted, thus encouraging meaningful discussions and perspective-taking. Adopting the approach of experiential learning provides platforms for students to immerse and reflect on their learning experiences through the school’s Values-In-Action (VIA) and Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programmes. These lessons and learning experiences help students make sense of their identity, build strong relationships and make responsible choices. Through the coherence of the school’s CCE programmes, we believe that every SGSian, anchored in strong values and with well-developed SEC, will grow to become confident and self-directed learners who care for and contribute actively to their family, school and nation. </p>

##### **VIA@SGS**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In alignment with the approach of providing authentic and collaborative learning experiences for SGS students, VIA @SGS adopts the Design Thinking model when planning sustainable VIA projects or activities for the community. These projects are planned and carried out through the school’s CCA programmes. The benchmarks for the projects are aligned to the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Nurturing Confident and Compassionate Leaders. Below are the outcomes and the process for VIA@ SGS. </p>
