The Singapore Red Cross Youth (RCY) is part of the largest humanitarian network in the world – the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In RCY, we aim to integrate character-building, leadership, essential life-saving skills and blood donation knowledge, local community service and overseas humanitarian projects in our curriculum, focusing on the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity. We strive to instil the Red Cross Youth spirit and build values such as compassion, passion and professionalism in all members. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In SGS, Red Cross Youths go through a series of programmes, such as combined Uniformed Group camps, leadership camps, bonding activities and skills-based courses such as first aid and disaster management in order to train our cadets to become adaptable, resilient and confident team players with a strong foundation in first aid knowledge as we uphold the Red Cross Promise: </p>
