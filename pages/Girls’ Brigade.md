<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Girls’ Brigade 55th Company aims to provide girls and young women with the opportunity to grow and lead, thereby developing them to their fullest potential. To equip, empower and enable every Girl to be a leader, and every Officer a Servant Leader, the company organise a holistic selection of activities such as camps, drills and badge work. These include both indoor and outdoor activities such as handicrafts, community outreach, outdoor cooking and learning journeys around Singapore. All of these will provide our girls with multiple opportunities to lead, plan and participate. </p>

##### **Key programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The GB programme is meant to develop the girls' character, social-emotional and leadership competencies. Through planning and executing activities such as camps and VIA activities, girls will learn good values, be equipped with leadership skills, and be given the opportunities to lead and serve at home, in the company, and in the community. Leadership equipping opportunities are structured into the yearly programme, spiralling up from Sec 1, allowing girls to attain the rank of Staff Sergeant by Sec 4 or Sec 5 of their leadership journey. The girls are also empowered to represent the company and school at national competitions, such as the National Drill Competition and the Low Guat Tin Challenge. </p>
