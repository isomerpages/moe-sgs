##### School Life

**What are your school hours like?**

Students are to be in school by 7.50 a.m. Flag raising begins at 8 a.m.

Curriculum time ends at 3.20pm on Mondays, 2.00pm on Tuesday to Thursdays and 12.40pm on Fridays.

**How late are students expected to stay in school each day?**

This depends on whether your child is scheduled for CCAs (Tuesday, Thursday and/or Friday) and additional learning programmes. 

Should your child be required to stay in school beyond the dismissal time indicated in his or her timetable, you will be informed by the school in advance.

**What are the various CCAs offered in the school?**

We have 19 CCAs in total which include Clubs and Societies, Performaing Arts (PAs), Sports as well as Uniformed Groups (UGs).

For Clubs and Societies, we have Earth Club, Media Club and Robotics.
For PAs, we have Choir, Concert Band, Dance, Guzheng Ensemble and Language Arts Club (LAC).
For Sports, we have Badminton, Floorball and Netball for girls; Badminton, Basketball, Football and Table Tennis for boys.
We also have UGs like the Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade, National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) and the Red Cross Youth.

**What subject combinations does your school offer to Secondary 3 pupils? Does your school offer Pure Science?**

In addition to the core subjects of Languages and Math, we also offer a range of electives such as History, Geography and Literature in English for Combined Humanities; and Physics, Chemistry and Biology for Combined Sciences. Also, we offer subjects like Principles of Accounts, Food and Nutrition, and Design and Technology. Students may choose to offer up to 6 or 7 subjects, depending on their level of readiness and their performance in Secondary 2.

From year to year, the subject combinations eventually offered, including Pure Sciences and Pure Humanities, may vary depending on the students’ preferences, their aptitude to do well in these subjects, as well as the school’s available teaching resources.

##### Special Programmes
**What is your Applied Learning Programme (ALP)?**

In line with our vision of nuturing SGSians as ‘Learning with Grit, Leaders with Heart’, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), entitled “Researching Society through Media Literacy” focuses on equipping our students with necessary media communication skills to think critically and deeply about society issues. Over the three-year programme, students progressively hone competencies such as media literacy, critical thinking and media creations skills to facilitate their research and present their findings.

Through the ALP, our students grow in confidence as they learn to manage an independent project, effectively work with others and present their research through different mediums. At the end of the project, there is the ALP Celebrations, where students share their research and solutions to societal issues with the SGSians family.

**Will there be opportunities for my child to develop leadership skills? What is your Learning for Life Programme (LLP)?**

All students have the opportunity to undergo leadership skills development in SGS, under our ‘Learning for Life Programme’ to grow as ‘Confident and Compassionate Leaders’. As part of our inclusive approach for student leadership development, all students have the opportunity to serve as a students-leader at the class, CCA or school level through the SGS Leadership by Choice platform. Through our LLP, students are equipped with skills to lead themselves, work with their peers through customised leadership programmes and lead in various settings in school.

**Are there other signature programmes offered?**

Our school’s Level Signature Programmes (LSPs) provide opportunities for SGSians to experience learning beyond their classrooms, in the domains of Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and Social (CAMPS). It aims to enhance our students’ social and emotional competencies and deepen their 21st Century Competencies through authentic experiential Learning. During LSPs, all students are engaged in specially curated and customised activities such as Overseas Immersion Trips, Outdoor Adventure Learning Cohort Camps, Learning Journeys and visits to various Institutions of Higher Education. 

Selected secondary 3 students also have the opportunity to embark on Overseas Learning Journeys to develop global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities. These experiences enable them to gain a deeper understanding of the place of Singapore in the world.
