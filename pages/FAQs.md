Does your school offer Pure Science?</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The school offers a diverse range of subject combinations that will enable
students to access all the different post-secondary school pathways.</p>
<p>In addition to the core subjects of Languages and Math, we also offer
a range of electives such as History, Geography and Literature in English
for Combined Humanities; and Physics, Chemistry and Biology for Combined
Sciences. Also, we offer subjects like Principles of Accounts, Food and
Nutrition, and Design and Technology. Students may choose to offer up to
6 or 7 subjects, depending on their level of readiness and their performance
in Secondary 2.</p>
<p>From year to year, the subject combinations eventually offered, including
Pure Sciences and Pure Humanities, may vary depending on the students’
preferences, their aptitude to do well in these subjects, as well as the
school’s available teaching resources.</p>

<p>What is your Applied Learning Programme (ALP)?</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>In line with our vision of nurturing SGSians as ‘Learning with Grit, Leaders
with Heart’, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), entitled “Researching
Society through Media Literacy” focuses on equipping our students with
necessary information skills to think critically and deeply about society
issues. Over the three-year programme, students progressively hone competencies
such as evaluating digital information with discernment, critical and inventing
thinking, communication and collaborative skills to facilitate their research
and present their findings.</p>
<p>Through the ALP, our students grow in confidence as they learn to manage
an independent project, effectively work with others and present their
research through different mediums. At the end of the project, there is
the ALP Celebrations, where students share their research and solutions
to societal issues with the SGSians family and the community.</p>

<p>Are there other signature programmes offered?</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Our school’s Level Signature Programmes (LSPs) provide opportunities for
SGSians to experience learning beyond their classrooms, in the domains
of Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and Social (CAMPS). It aims to
enhance our students’ social and emotional competencies and deepen their
21st Century Competencies through authentic experiential Learning. During
LSPs, all students are engaged in specially curated and customised activities
such as Overseas Immersion Trips, Outdoor Adventure Learning Cohort Camps,
Learning Journeys and visits to various Institutions of Higher Education.</p>
<p>Selected secondary 3 students also have the opportunity to embark on Overseas
Learning Journeys to develop global awareness and cross-cultural skills
and sensitivities. These experiences enable them to gain a deeper understanding
of the place of Singapore in the world.</p>
