In line with our vision of nuturing SGSians as 'Learning with Grit, Leaders with Heart',
our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), entitled "Researching Society through Media Literacy"
focuses on equipping our students with necessary media communication

Through the ALP, our students grow in confidence as they learn to manage an

Different mediums. At the end of the project, there is the ALP Celebrations, where students share their research and solutions to societal issues with the SGSians family.

Our school’s Level Signature Programmes (LSPs) aim to enhance our students’ social

Over the course of three to four days, all levels of students are engaged in specially curated and customized activities such as overseas learning trips, outdoor and adventure camp, healthy lifestyle lessons and sessions on education and career guidance for our graduating cohort, who get to visit the Polytechnics and various industries. Over the past years, our Secondary Two students, for example have the opportunity to visit Penang and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. For many of them, the highlight of these trips is the opportunity to meet their peers from the local schools.
