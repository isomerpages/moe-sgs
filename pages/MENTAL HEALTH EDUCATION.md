Serangoon Garden’s Mental Health Education (MHE) Programme is designed to achieve the following goals for our students, as defined by MOE’s Student Development Curriculum Division (SCDC). It aims to:

*   G1: <u>Strengthen students’ resilience and well-being</u> for good mental health
*   G2: Guide students to understand <u>mental health as a continuum </u>(mental wellness to mental illness)
*   G3: Develop in students an <u>understanding of mental illness</u> and their treatments
*   G4: Enhance students’ <u>help-seeking</u> efficacy 
*   G5: <u>Destigmatise mental illness</u>for our students

In line with the goals stated above, the MHE curriculum in Serangoon Garden Secondary School has developed and customised a series of programmes for our students. The table below states the range of topics covered in the MHE curriculum from Sec 1 to 4, outlining the Skills, Knowledge, Values and Attitude which will be covered in the various aspects of your child’s school experiences- including FT Periods, CCE lessons, assembly programmes and Level Signature Programmes.

**(Below are the lessons found in the CCE 2021 Curriculum and some we have crafted so far that are related to Mental Health Education)**
