<p style="text-align: justify;"> The SGS Choir is all about discovering and nurturing a passion for singing and performing.  The vision of the Choir is for each and every member to become gracious citizens, resilient musicians and confident performers. The Choir believes in holistically developing each member’s talents as a performer, and therefore includes choreography and drama as part of our curriculum. Most importantly, we are strong advocates of character building, and aim to groom young ladies and gentlemen of commendable moral courage and fibre. In terms of repertoire, we do not limit our musical education to merely classical choral pieces, but also learn popular hits like “Stitches” by Shawn Mendes and “Best Day of My Life” by American Authors. </p>

##### **CCA Training in times of COVID-19**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In view of the current COVID-19 situation, the SGS Choir took on a new challenge of performing virtually through music videos!  The students enjoyed the process, experiencing how it is like, to record their voices in a studio setting.  Through this virtual performance platform, it was indeed a brand new experience for our students to go through the process of music video creation themselves. The students then had the opportunity to collaborate with their peers from the Dance and Media club, to piece the video segments together, as a gift to our teachers during Teacher’s Day celebration. Our Choir learnt and enjoyed themselves through the new performance channel and platform, to make the best out of their learning experiences! Besides school performances, SGS Choir has also taken part in external virtual performances event such as Voices of Singapore 2021: Concert of Singapore Choirs. This virtual performance event showcase choirs with members of different ages and from all walks of life. </p>
