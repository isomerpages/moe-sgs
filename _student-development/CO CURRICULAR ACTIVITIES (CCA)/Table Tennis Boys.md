<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Table Tennis team in Serangoon Garden Secondary Schools believes that CCA is a key component of students’ holistic education. Through Table Tennis sessions, students develop their character through learning values such as perseverance, respect, and diligence, social competencies and skills to prepare them for future challenges. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> CCA sessions also provide students the platform to interact with peers from diverse backgrounds and participate in Values-in-Action (VIA) programmes to contribute meaningfully to the society. In 2021, the students honed their innovation skills by harnessing the Design Thinking framework to ideate solutions to mitigate environmental pollution. Each student came up with an interesting project to raise awareness of common environmental problems, and to advocate a greener lifestyle among their peers and loved ones. Kevin Ho from 1 Respect shared more about his experience: “The VIA experience this year was meaningful even though we could not head out in teams. The focus on caring for the environment was relevant to us as we reconsidered how we could adopt a greener lifestyle as we advocated it.” </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Every year, our students participate in the South Zone Table Tennis Championships and Table Tennis Individual Championships (National). Through these competitions, they learn to overcome the odds, strengthen their confidence level and foster a sense of responsibility and accountability to their team. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The team is heartened that Skyler Ang Wei Zhi of 4 Integrity was nominated for the National Young Leader Award in 2021 in recognition of his positive influence on the team, as he upheld the values of integrity and diligence through his hard work and determination. </p>
