<p style="text-align: justify;"> The SGS Basketball team believes that CCA plays an important role in developing learners with GRIT, and leaders with heart in Serangoon Garden Secondary School. To that end, we aim to develop values such as perseverance, respect, and diligence among our players. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Staying true to these values, our boys put in their best performance in all competitions. Every year, our school basketball team will participate in the South Zone Basketball Championships and T-Net Basketball competitions. Our boys also undergo gym programs as part of their physical training. Through trainings and competitions, our players develop their self-confidence, perseverance to overcome the odds of winning and empathy towards their opponents. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In addition, the CCA also acts as a platform for the students to forge friendships and bonding outside of the classroom environment. Hence, the students can excel physically and emotionally as they participate in and grow through the Basketball programme in SGS. </p>

##### **CCA Training in times of COVID-19**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Our basketball members re-oriented themselves in face of COVID-19.  Instead of the usual physical training sessions, our coaches instructed the boys, via zoom sessions, on guided exercises, with supervision of the CCA teachers. ‘Physical Conditioning’ was the focus of our first e-CCA session, where the boys, together with the coach and teachers had a tiring but worthwhile workout. The subsequent sessions provided opportunities for our boys to stay connected to one another as they keep themselves physically fit and mentally disciplined.  Both our boys, together with their parents welcome this initiative. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Whenever possible of course, training is pivoted back to physical training sessions as the default, in compliance with all Safety Management Measures in place. </p>
