The SGS Guzheng Ensemble nurtures in students a deep appreciation for the traditional Chinese instrument. In the Ensemble, students are encouraged to demonstrate values of perseverance and diligence as they work together as a team to train their coordination, focus and musicality.

##### What We Do

Members have many opportunities to perform during school events like the SGS Awards Presentation Day, Garden Fiesta and Chinese New Year Celebrations. They have also performed at The French School and NEX Shopping Mall. In addition, students participate in combined schools concerts that serve as platforms for them to meet like-minded friends with a common interest in traditional Chinese music and to hone their playing skills. These experiences also help build performance experience and stage confidence in the students.

The Ensemble gives back to society through its VIA programme. In 2021, they collaborated with the SGSS Girl Guides and partnered with Ren Ci Nursing Home to spread cheers to the elderly residents. The students led, planned and carried out interactions that include sharing about the Guzheng and its characteristics, making handicrafts for the residents, playing games and carrying out quizzes with them online. The elderly also enjoyed viewing videos of the Ensemble’s performances.
