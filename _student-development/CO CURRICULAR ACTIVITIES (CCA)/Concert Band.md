<p style="text-align: justify;"> The SGS Concert Band is made up of students who are passionate and enthusiastic about music. We rehearse and perform together regularly and bond through our love for music. The Concert Band provides a great opportunity for anyone to pick up an instrumental skill and to learn to read music notation, regardless of your background. It is a place for music lovers to experience the joy of music-making together. </p>

The band performs regularly at various school functions as well as at external venues. One of the more memorable recent performance was at the Junior Band Festival 2017 held at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Lee Foundation Theatre, where we performed to an audience of nearly 400! </p>
