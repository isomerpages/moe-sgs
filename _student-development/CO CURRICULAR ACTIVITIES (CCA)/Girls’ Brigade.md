The Serangoon Garden Secondary School Girls’ Brigade aims to help girls develop to their fullest potential by imbuing leadership and responsibility in our girls. In line with the GB90 vision “Grow and Go Beyond – Extend. Serve. Lead.”, our company maintains strong ties with Trinity Methodist Church.

Our company aims to provide our girls with a wide range of experiences such as outdoor adventure and numerous service learning opportunities to equip them with necessary life skills, empowering each of them to make good decisions and display a sense of responsibility towards the community.

Our company also prides ourselves on instilling discipline and tenacity in our girls. In the 2017 National Day Parade, we were proud to witness 2 of our cadets, Fareena and Sangita, representing the school in the Girls’ Brigade contingent. Through their experiences in the SGS Girls’ Brigade, our girls will mature into sensitive and caring individuals with a strong spirit of service.
