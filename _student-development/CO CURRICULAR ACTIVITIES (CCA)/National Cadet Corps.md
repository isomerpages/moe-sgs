**Lion head**

The lion, also known as the king of the jungle, is symbolic of 2 characteristics that every cadet should have: leadership and bravery.

**Leadership**

Every cadet should not only learn how to lead himself through self-discipline, but also how to lead others through servant leadership (help others so as to move forward as a unit).

**Bravery**

Through fun, adventurous and military-related activities, cadets are given meaningful opportunities to courageously challenge themselves, with the nurturing support of fellow cadets, seniors and teacher officers.
