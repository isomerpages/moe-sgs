“I feel really proud and honoured to be part of the SGS netball team. I learnt about perseverance and teamwork. We show respect and empathy towards each other and even towards our opponents.”

“Being part of the SGS Netball Team is like being part of the family. We forge great loyalty and friendship in our team.”

“It alleviates my stress as I’m able to confide in my teammates.”

Anyone can steer a ship in calm waters, but not every student is able to weather through difficulties with resilience and fortitude. Here, SGS Netball offers an enriching and fruitful journey of self-discovery, where fine young ladies learn the importance of passion, appreciate the value of teamwork, and embrace the magic of persistence. They also form ties of comradeship.

The CCA presents our girls with an array of opportunities that include Zonal competitions, sports carnivals, camps and even values-in-action programmes.
