In alignment with the approach of providing authentic and collaborative learning experiences for SGS students, VIA @SGS adopts the Design Thinking model when planning sustainable VIA projects or activities for the community. These projects are planned and carried out through the school’s CCA programmes. The benchmarks for the projects are aligned to the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Nurturing Confident and Compassionate Leaders. Below are the outcomes and the process for VIA@ SGS.
