<p style="text-align: justify;"> The SGS Choir aims to nurture the passion for singing, and develop each member into resilient musicians and confident performers. The Choir encourages holistic development of members by providing a variety of project opportunities and leadership positions. In terms of repertoire, we do not limit our musical education to classical choral pieces, but also dabble in popular pop hits such as Ed Sheeran’s ‘Perfect’. </p>


##### **Key programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In 2021, the SGS Choir mainly participated in E-performances due to the Safety Management Measures (SMM) imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through recorded videos, the Choir took part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, and the Voices of Singapore Festival. Since the lowering of SMM in 2022, the Choir participated in a variety of events, performances, and competitions. For instance, the Choir took part in school-based events such as in the Garden Fiesta IV concert, and the Friendship through Song Concert in collaboration with various secondary school choirs. The Choir also participated in International Competitions - we were awarded the Silver Award for the Taipei International Choral Competition (TICC), and were placed as the Top 10 finalist for the International Seakeepers Society Songwriting Competition (ISWC). The Choir is also actively works with the Community through a variety of Values-in-Action (VIA) Projects. In the past 2 years, we have worked with organizations such as the Chen Su Lan Methodist Children’s Home, MINDSville, and PCF Sparkletots. </p>
