The SGS Choir aims to nurture the passion for singing, and develop each member into resilient musicians and confident performers. The Choir encourages holistic development of members by providing a variety of project opportunities and leadership positions. In terms of repertoire, we do not limit our musical education to classical choral pieces, but also dabble in popular pop hits such as Ed Sheeran’s ‘Perfect’. 


##### **Key programmes**

Since the lowering of SMM in 2022, the Choir participated in a variety of events, performances, and competitions. For instance, the Choir took part in school-based events such as in the Garden Fiesta IV concert, and the Friendship through Song Concert in collaboration with various secondary school choirs. The Choir also participated in International Competitions - we were awarded the Silver Award for the Taipei International Choral Competition (TICC), and were placed as the Top 10 finalist for the International Seakeepers Society Songwriting Competition (ISWC). 
In 2023, the Choir participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, and was awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment. The Choir also worked with various secondary schools through choral exchanges; our collaboration culminated in our presentation at the Voices of Singapore (VOS) Festival 2023 held at CHIJMES. A group of Choir members also represented the school to take part in the 新空下 National Schools Xinyao Festival 2023; their original composition titled 做自己 was placed among the top 10 submissions for the competition, and the group was presented the Merit Award. 
The Choir is also actively works with the Community through a variety of Values-in-Action (VIA) Projects. In the past 2 years, we have planned projects and performances for organizations such as MINDSville, PCF Sparkletots, and Ling Kwang Home for Senior Citizens.
