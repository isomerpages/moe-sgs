## Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) in Secondary School Education

Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) plays a key role in the holistic development of our students. It provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents for a life-long love for a particular activity, skill or interest. This will subsequently help the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood.

Beyond the CCA-specific skills, all CCA emphasises social interaction by providing a common space for friendships and social integration among students of diverse backgrounds. By learning and interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the school and community. CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn values, social and emotional competencies, and the emerging 21st Century Competencies to make students future ready.

Besides inculcating values, CCA also imbues in our students an entrepreneurial spirit, a risk-taking attitude and a sense of appreciation and gratitude to contribute back to the community, all of which are necessary for the holistic development of an individual.

Participation in CCA is compulsory for all secondary school students.
