<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Girl Guides is a worldwide movement to “enable girls and young women to develop their fullest potential and become responsible citizens of the world”. Standing by its motto, ‘Be Prepared’, SGS 1st Company Guides is always reliable when called upon. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> SGS Guides empowers girls through fun and challenging programmes. They diligently pursue personal growth and sharpen their leadership and life skills through diverse activities, from outdoor skills to handicrafts. SGS Guides take pride in what they do and persevere through the toughest situations. They make lifelong friendships and make a positive impact on those around them. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Together with the school and community, SGS Guides strive to develop our young ladies into women of tomorrow with leadership qualities and a critical mind. It is an honour for the SGS Guides to be awarded the 2019 Gold Puan Noor Aishah Award for the 11th consecutive year. The award is a recognition of the Girl Guides’ relentless effort in pursuing the best and giving back to the school and community. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The unit is equally proud of the achievement of one of its Guides, Maizurah Binte Mohamad Khaizal from 4 Integrity (2021). She received the prestigious Baden-Powell Award in 2021, the highest award given out by the Girl Guides Chief Commissioner to a Girl Guide, in recognition of her leadership potential and development in Girl Guides. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> To contribute to the well-being of the community, SGSS Guides has maintained a close partnership with Ren Ci Nursing Home since 2019.  For example, they spent time doing art and craft with the seniors in 2019. They also engaged them virtually through quizzes, songs and games during National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival in 2021. </p>

		 
##### **Key programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Using the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) model and Girl Guides 5-point programme as a guideline, activities are organised for Guides to maximise their potential. </p>

1. Annual Guides Camp

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Guides can look forward to camping outdoors, where they can gain new experiences and develop resilience as they engage in activities such as tent-pitching, outdoor cooking using firewood, and the tying of different knots and lashes. The Guides learn to work in teams and persevere through adversity, as they engage in a variety of enrichment activities such as laser tag and kite-flying </p>


2. HQ & Division Events

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Guides take the initiative to plan and organise competition or learning booths for girls from other units for events such as World Thinking Day, South Division Day and South Division Learning Day. As they share their knowledge and skills with others, the Guides build confidence in their abilities and learn to step outside of their comfort zones. In 2022, the Guides conducted a virtual eco-friendly craft workshop through the making of paper baskets and plant hangers using twine. </p>

3. Badges

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Guides enjoy working for interest badges and awards that will help them develop new skills and develop in their character. For example, the WAGGGS badges such as the Action on Body Confidence badge gives Guides a chance to stop and reflect on the world around them, and the influence it has on the way they think about themselves and other people. The Hostess Badge allows the Guides to practise being gracious hosts and build social awareness by engaging their guests.

4. Leadership Initiatives

<p style="text-align: justify;"> SGS Guides also actively champion campaigns to advocate for causes such as environmental and water conservation, cyber-wellness, mental health, anti-smoking, kindness and many more.
	
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In order to contribute to the well-being of the community, SGS Guides maintains a close partnership with Ren Ci Nursing Home since 2019. Our guides spent time doing art and craft with the seniors in 2019. They also engaged them virtually during National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival 2021 through quizzes, songs and games, through collaborating with fellow schoolmates from Band and Guzheng. In 2022, the Guides shared about environmental awareness through planting microgreens and making paper baskets with the children from Bethel Preschool. All these experiences further develops a sense of responsibility that the Guides have for the people around them.
	
5. Service to School
	
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Guides actively lend their support to the school through various events such as flag-raising during the school’s morning assembly, National Day Parade, skills sharing of origami through the Level Signature Programme and hosting of guests during the school’s concert Garden Fiesta 2022.
