##### **CCA Training in times of COVID-19**

<p style="text-align: justify;">In view of the current COVID-19 situation, sessions were conducted via ZOOM where the instructors taught essential skills for photography and videography. Â Secondary 1 students and selected Secondary 3 students did photography while the Secondary 2 and selected Secondary 3 students did videography.

<p style="text-align: justify;">For photography, students were introduced compositional techniques and various camera angles. For videography, essential skills like scripting, acting and editing were taught.

<p style="text-align: justify;">After each session for both photography and videography, students were given time to practice and apply what they have learnt. At the end of the session, students will share and reflect their process and clarify any doubts they have with the instructors.
