<p style="text-align: justify;">SGSS Media Club, also affectionately known as SGSS Media Studio is home to students 
who enjoy making short films, taking photographs or working with sound systems. 
Students will be trained to capture school events through photography and videography, 
to preserve the memories of their secondary school experience. Media Club members 
will also be content creators, embarking on their own projects such photo journals, 
short films and podcasts.
	
	
##### **Key Programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The programmes of the club are organized along 5 developmental pillars: Lead, Learn, Serve, Excel, and Discover.

##### **Lead:**
	
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Media Club, it is envisioned that every member will be a reflective leader who 
seeks continuous growth in themselves and others. They will have the opportunity to lead 
their peers during various media projects and join the studentâ€™s executive committee to 
chart the direction of the CCA.

##### **Learn:**
	

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through the guidance of professional instructors and the teachers-in-charge, 
Secondary 1 students would learn the fundamentals of photography, including 
compositional techniques and the operation of a DSLR camera. Secondary 2 students 
would undergo training in videography, cultivating essential skills such as storyboarding, 
video-recording, and video-editing. For Upper Secondary students, they would apply their 
media skills to good causes through student-initiated Values-in-Action projects.

photography and videography support for school events. In addition, they seek to raise 
awareness for good social causes through creating multimodal media products such as 
a photo series, video interviews, and podcast episodes exploring current topics.
