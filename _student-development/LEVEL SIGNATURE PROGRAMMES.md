The Level Signature Programme (LSP) is unique to Serangoon Garden Secondary School.  The programme seeks to 

*   provide opportunities for SGSians to experience learning beyond their classrooms, and
*   strengthen peer and teacher-student relationship (TSR) through participating in the activities together.

Every year, pupils of all levels participate in programmes, specially curated for each level.  The pupils of Secondary 1, for example participate in a Healthy Lifestyle Programme where they learn various sports and games such as archery.  They will also learn the importance of healthy eating through making healthy sandwiches, taught and guided by our own teachers from the Food and Nutrition Department.

The Secondary 2s, on the other hand, would get to travel overseas to our neighbouring country, Malaysia.  In 2019, the cohort went on a 4D3N immersion trip to Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Kuching. They visited various places of interests and schools, and they had the opportunity to be part of a VIA programme in a charitable home.  

The Secondary 3s were involved in a 4D3N camp at the MOE Adventure Camp, located in Changi.  They participated in various water sports such as canoeing, high elements and even went on a trail to the Central Business District (CBD).  Physically straining, our pupils had to work together in pairs and teams to overcome the challenges arising from the above activities. 

Our graduating cohort, the Secondary 4s/5s were attached to the various Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), to learn about the various courses these institutions offer.  They were involved in lively discussions, experiments, workshop visits over the 3-day attachment.  The attachment provided opportunities for our graduating pupils to make informed decisions in their course application, upon graduation from SGS.
