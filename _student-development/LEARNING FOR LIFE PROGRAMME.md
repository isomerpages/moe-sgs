The SGS Learning for Life Programme (LLP) aims to nurture confident and compassionate leaders who will serve the school and the community. In SGS, we provide leadership training for all students to discover their strengths and build leadership competencies in them.

Students with a greater aptitude and interests in learning and serving will be given opportunities to participate in advanced leadership courses and apply their learning in leading class/school-wide/community events. Through experiential learning and mentoring, our student leaders will develop an entrepreneurial spirit in them to apply what they had learnt while broadening their influence in impacting the community.
