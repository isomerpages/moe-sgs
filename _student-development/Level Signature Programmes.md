**The Level Signature Programmes (LSPs)** are unique to Serangoon Garden Secondary School and specially curated. The programmes seek to 

(i) provide opportunities for SGSians to experience learning beyond their classrooms, in the domains of Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and Social (CAMPS)  
(ii) strengthen peer support and teacher-student rapport.

Every year, our students look forward to participating in LSPs, three times a year, organized at the end of Term 1, 2 and 4. The themes are **‘Discover’, “Enrich’ and ‘Celebrate’** within each LSP. 

The theme **‘Discover’** is about our students exploring and discovering their talents, passions and their heritage; the theme **‘Enrich’** is about providing opportunities for our students to apply their knowledge, skills and competencies to authentic real-world context and the last theme is **‘Celebrate’** which affirms our students’ different talents and passion in the domains of Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and Social.
