<p>The school year came to a rousing finish with the Semestral Awards Day
last Friday, where we celebrated students' achievements in both academic
and non-academic domains. The Ho Bee Foundation Scholarship award recognises
well-rounded students who have excelled in both academic and non-academic
spheres, and who exemplify the PRIDE values of the school. The PRIDE Award
recognises students for demonstrating exemplary character, displaying civic
responsibility and upholding our school values through words and actions.
We also celebrated students' academic achievements, affirming the effort
and hard work they put in throughout this year. Indeed, SGS students have
learnt well, served well, and led well in 2025!</p>
