##### **2024 Sec 1 Registration: Medical Appeal Exercise (MAE) – Thursday, 21 December 2023, 8.30 am to 12 pm**

Dear Parent/Guardian 

If you would like to seek a transfer out of our school for your P6 child/ward, who has recently received his/her secondary school posting in 2023, based on the **following serious medical conditions**, please contact the school at 6288 9227 and ask for Ms Tay Hui Yih, Lower Sec Year Head. 

a.	**Serious Medical Conditions.** Students with persistent or serious illness e.g. chronic heart conditions, kidney problems. An official letter from a certified doctor must be attached to the application. 

b.	**Severe Physical Impairments**. Students with physical impairments. An assessment from qualified medical professional(s) of the student’s conditions and needs should be submitted. The assessment should clearly describe the extent of impairments (temporary/permanent) and the type of assistive device that the student is currently using (e.g. those requiring permanent use of a wheelchair). 

Thank you.
