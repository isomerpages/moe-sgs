<h4><strong>General Conduct</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Always use the 3D printer under the supervision of a teacher or trained
adult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not touch or adjust the printer without permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report any unusual smells, sounds, or malfunctions to the teacher immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never attempt to modify, dismantle, or repair the printer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Safe Printing Practices</strong></h4>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Only approved designs and filaments are allowed. Printing of weapons or
prohibited items is strictly against the law (GEWCA 2021).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use only safe filaments such as PLA, PLA+, PCL, or PETG. Do not use ABS
filament (it releases toxic fumes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stereolithography (SLA) printers are not to be used by students due to
hazardous resins.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Handling &amp; Operation</strong></h4>
<ol start="8" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not touch moving parts while the printer is operating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait until the print has finished and cooled before removing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use tweezers to remove any filament stuck to hot nozzles. Do not touch
the nozzle directly (burn risk).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a scraper to carefully remove prints from the heated bed â€” do not
use bare hands.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Environment &amp; Safety Equipment</strong></h4>
<ol start="12" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ensure the room is well-ventilated during printing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the printer area free of clutter, liquids, and flammable materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The printer must be placed on a sturdy, stable surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wear safety goggles and gloves if instructed by your teacher.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Records &amp; Responsibility</strong></h4>
<ol start="16" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All prints must be logged in the 3D printing record book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are responsible for cleaning up their work area after use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If in doubt, always ask your teacher for help before proceeding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
