##### **SCHOOL COUNSELLING**

Our school counsellors work collaboratively with our students to:

*   facilitate the expansion of their view of life, enhance his/her social and emotional development and explore coping resources; and
*   manage his/her challenges and make choices for change in himself/herself.

We strongly encourage students to arrange for talk-it-through sessions with the counsellor to discuss any issues that he/she may be concerned with.

##### **Learning & Behavioural Support**

Our AED (LBS) supports students in the following:

* provide structured and systematic support to students with educational needs through:

1.             In-Class support
2.             Withdrawal sessions: small group or 1-to-1 extra support
3.             Skills training: social skills, study and organization skills including time management

* help students with educational needs to better integrate into mainstream schools and classes

We are located at Block D Room 02-01 (R Centre) and Room 02-02.

School Counsellors :

Mdm Loh Lai Choon (6578 9172)

The road of life twists and turns and no two directions are ever the same. Yet our lessons come from the journey, not the destination.  ~ Don Williams, Jr.

##### **Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Counselling**

Our ECG Counsellor supports students (individually or in small groups) with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions for smoother transition to further education or work.

Our ECG Counsellor works collaboratively with students to:

*   build awareness of self’s career interests, strengths and passion;
*   explore relevant courses of study and educational pathways; and
*   discover the world of work.

Our ECG Counsellor is available at the V-Hub on Wednesdays.

Students could find out more information from the ECG noticeboard located in the school canteen and the V-Hub.

ECG Counsellor:  Ms Camilla Teo
