##### **SCHOOL COUNSELLING**

Our school counsellors work collaboratively with our students to:

*   facilitate the expansion of their view of life, enhance his/her social and emotional development and explore coping resources; and
*   manage his/her challenges and make choices for change in himself/herself.

**We strongly encourage students to arrange for talk-it-through sessions with the counsellor to discuss any issues that he/she may be concerned with.**

##### **Learning & Behavioural Support**

Our AED (LBS) supports students in the following:

*   provide structured and systematic support to students with educational needs through:
