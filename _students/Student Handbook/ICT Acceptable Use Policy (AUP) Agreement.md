the device, you must make a police report and report the matter to the
school.</p>

designated charging stations, during recess and/or after-school hours.</p>
<p>5. You are reminded to keep your PLD updated by installing the relevant
patches and updates when being prompted by the system.</p>
<p>6. All PLDs are installed with a Device Management Application (DMA) to
support a safe and conducive learning environment. You should not attempt
to bypass the DMA.</p>
<p>7. You are responsible for regularly backing up your learning materials
in your PLD to prevent data loss.</p>
