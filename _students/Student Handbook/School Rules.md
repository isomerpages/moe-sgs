<p>The School Rules serve to guide and encourage positive behaviour, which
is integral to fostering a caring, safe and fair environment where learning
can take place.</p>
<p>Rules and consequences are communicated to students so that they are clear
of the expectations of the school and the consequences should they fall
short of these expectations. The table of offences and their corresponding
consequences can be found <a href="/files/SGS_Discipline_Policy__For_Website___Cleared_.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>
</p>
<p>The SGS community believes in holistic education centred on values and
character development. Through a culture of care and mutual respect, we
nurture our students into Learners with Grit and Leaders with Heart. Using
daily routines and teachable moments, we cultivate our students’ social
and emotional competencies, and inculcate the school values of PRIDE: Perseverance,
Respect, Integrity, Diligence, and Empathy.</p>
<p>SGS adopts Restorative Practices (RP) to proactively build relationships
and a sense of community to prevent conflict and wrong-doing. RP is characterised
by high control (limit-setting, discipline) and high support (encourage,
nurture) processes, and is rooted in the values of Responsibility, Respect,
Compassion, Support, Restoring, Trust and Restitution. In addressing actions
that do not respect the rules, we are able to tap on the established relationships
to foster cooperative behaviour, thus minimising the need for punitive
measures. In addition to facilitating the inculcation of values and social
and emotional competencies, we believe that RP will help develop students
who are happier, more cooperative and productive, and more likely to make
positive changes in their behaviour.</p>
