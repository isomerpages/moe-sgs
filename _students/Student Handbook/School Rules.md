<p style="text-align: justify;"> The SGS community believes in holistic education centred on values and character development. Through a culture of care and mutual respect, we nurture our students into Learners with Grit and Leaders with Heart. Using daily routines and teachable moments, we cultivate our students’ social and emotional competencies, and inculcate the school values of PRIDE: Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence, and Empathy. The School Rules serve to guide and encourage positive behaviour, which is integral to fostering a caring and safe environment where learning can take place. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> SGS adopts Restorative Practices (RP) to proactively build relationships and a sense of community to prevent conflict and wrong-doing. RP is characterised by high control (limit-setting, discipline) and high support (encourage, nurture) processes, and is rooted in the values of Responsibility, Respect, Compassion, Support, Restoring, Trust and Restitution. In addressing actions that do not respect the rules, we are able to tap on the established relationships to foster cooperative behaviour, thus minimising the need for punitive measures. In addition to facilitating the inculcation of values and social and emotional competencies, we believe that RP will help develop students who are happier, more cooperative and productive, and more likely to make positive changes in their behaviour. </p>
