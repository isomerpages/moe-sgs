#### **School-Based Assessment 2022**

As part of our school’s efforts to balance the assessment load to better support our students’ learning, the weightings for our School-Based Assessment (SBA) for Secondary 1 to 3 students in 2022 are as follows:


##### What are Weighted Assessments?

For our **Sec 1 to 3** students, Weighted Assessments (WA) may take the form of short class tests, performance tasks, graded assignments, project work or oral presentations, varied and designed to support learning of students leveraging on formative assessment.

To better prepare our **Sec 4 and 5** students for the rigour of the national exams at the end of the year, WA 1 will be closely aligned to the scope of assessment of the national exams.

We seek your support to reinforce positive learning dispositions and attitudes in your child/ward by encouraging him/her to participate actively in lessons and stay engaged on the learning tasks and homework provided daily. These will help develop study habits and strengthen positive learning dispositions in them.

##### Schedule and Scope

The Sec 1 to 3 WA3 will take place from Week 3 to Week 8 of Term 3 and it will be conducted during timetabled lessons.  
The schedule and the scope of assessment are available at **[for.edu.sg/2022wa3](https://for.edu.sg/2022wa3).**

The Sec 4 & 5 Preliminary Examination schedules can be found at **[for.edu.sg/2022prelim](https://for.edu.sg/2022prelim).**

##### Students Absent from WA/MYE

Students who miss the WA/Exam due to medical reasons will need to produce a medical certificate covering the affected dates. Students who miss the WA/Exam without a valid reason will be awarded an Absent (AB) grade.
