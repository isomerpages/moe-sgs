<h3>School-Based Assessment 2024</h3>
<p>Assessment is an integral part of the school curriculum, and it provides
students and teachers with feedback that will help them address learning
gaps and improve teaching practices.</p>
<p>Typically, there will be one weighted assessment (WA) per subject from
Terms 1 to 3. The modes of WA could include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Performance Tasks (e.g., group presentation, project work)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tests (timed-based written assessment conducted during curriculum time)</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see Table 1 for the assessment weightings for Secondary 1 to 3
students for the year.</p>
