Annually, SGS students embark on Overseas Learning Journeys to develop global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities.  These experiences enable them to gain a deeper understanding of the place of Singapore in the world.  Over the years, students have visited our partner schools in various countries and cities including:
* Malaysia - Langkawi, Kuching, Penang and Kuala Lumpur
* Thailand - Chiang Mai, Bangkok and Kanchanaburi
* Vietnam - Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City
* China - Xian and Hong Kong
* Indonesia - Bali
* South Korea
* Cambodia 

In 2024, two groups of Sec 3 students went on trips to Bali and Penang respectively.   Both groups had the opportunity to participate in an exchange programme with the local schools.  Students also engaged in cultural immersion visits and experiences.  Students on the Bali trip embarked on field studies on coasts, volcanoes, tourism, and sustainability.  Those on the Penang trip visited UNESCO Heritage sites and studied local flora and fauna at Entopia and Penang Hill.  They also engaged in experiential learning activities, such as Batik painting and glass painting.
