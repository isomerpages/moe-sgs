Annually, SGS students embark on Overseas Learning Journeys to develop global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities.  These experiences enable them to gain a deeper understanding of the place of Singapore in the world.  Over the years, students have visited our partner schools in various countries and cities including:
* Malaysia - Langkawi, Kuching, Penang and Kuala Lumpur
* Thailand - Chiang Mai, Bangkok and Kanchanaburi
* Vietnam - Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City
* China - Xian and Hong Kong
* Indonesia - Bali
* South Korea
* Cambodia 

In 2025, 30 Secondary 3 students embarked on an enriching and unforgettable trip to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Over the course of four days, they learnt more about Vietnam’s war history as they trudged through the Cu Chi Tunnels, explored the War Remnants Museum, and the Independence Palace. They also engaged in hands-on activities and shared meaningful exchanges with local students. Students also explored the Mekong Delta and learnt about Saigon’s culture and innovations when they visited the Saigon Hi-Tech Park and a local barista school. Through it all, students gained cross-cultural skills and a deeper understanding of the place of Singapore in ASEAN and the world.

From 26 to 29 May 2025, 30 Secondary 3 students embarked on a cultural immersion trip to Suzhou and Shanghai. In Suzhou, students experienced a typical school day at Pingjiang Middle School, visited the Suzhou Industrial Park and historic sites like Master of the Nets Garden and Shantang Street, enjoyed Suzhou’s Pingtan performance, and explored the silk industry. In Shanghai, they learnt about urban development concepts at the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Centre, explored Xintiandi, Tianzifang, and the Oriental Pearl Tower, wrapping up their last evening with the ERA ‘Intersection of Time Acrobatics Show’. The trip developed students’ global awareness and cross-cultural skills and they returned, brimming with memories of their exciting experiences.

In 2024, two groups of Sec 3 students went on trips to Bali and Penang respectively.   Both groups had the opportunity to participate in an exchange programme with the local schools.  Students also engaged in cultural immersion visits and experiences.  Students on the Bali trip embarked on field studies on coasts, volcanoes, tourism, and sustainability.  Those on the Penang trip visited UNESCO Heritage sites and studied local flora and fauna at Entopia and Penang Hill.  They also engaged in experiential learning activities, such as Batik painting and glass painting.

SGS had the pleasure of hosting students and teachers from Choi Hung Estate Catholic Secondary School (Hong Kong SAR, China) as part of International Friendship Day (IFD) celebrations on 11 April 2025.

Our visitors participated in a special IFD concert and presented on their school, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), and academic experiences.  Together with their buddies, they attended lessons and enjoyed a hands-on experience when they proudly prepared and savoured Pad Thai during a Food and Consumer Education (FCE) lesson. 

This meaningful exchange provided an excellent platform for our students to develop communication skills and global literacy, as they interacted with peers from Hong Kong, fostering cross-cultural friendships and understanding.
