<p>From 13 to 16 October 2025, 12 Secondary 3 students embarked on a school
and cultural immersion trip to Brunei, where they gained deep insights
into the nation’s culture, traditions, and development. At landmarks such
as the Jame' Asr Hassanal Bolkiah Mosque, Istana Nurul Iman, and the Royal
Regalia Museum, they learnt about Brunei’s faith, leadership, and sense
of community. Visits to the ASEAN Sculpture Park, Kampong Ayer, and the
Malay Technology Museum helped them appreciate unity among ASEAN nations,
the balance between tradition and modernity, and the ingenuity of Bruneians
in the past. Through these experiences, the students reflected on values
of responsibility, gratitude, and cultural respect, drawing parallels between
Brunei’s progress and Singapore’s own development.</p>
<p>The students also enjoyed exploring Brunei’s natural beauty and modern
attractions. They were amazed by the grandeur of The Empire Brunei Hotel,
the breathtaking sunset views, and the majestic Sultan Haji Omar Ali Saifuddien
Bridge. Educational visits to the Energy Hub and Brunei Maritime Museum
deepened their understanding of sustainability and Brunei’s historical
role in regional trade. Interacting with students at Sekolah Tinggi Perempuan
Raja Isteri fostered cultural appreciation and friendship, while visits
to Tamu Kianggeh Market and Gadong Night Market showcased Brunei’s lively
local life. The trip not only enriched their knowledge of Bruneian culture
but also strengthened their bonds and appreciation for diversity, heritage,
and shared regional identity.</p>
