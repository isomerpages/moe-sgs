<p>SGS had the pleasure of hosting students and teachers from Choi Hung Estate
Catholic Secondary School (Hong Kong SAR, China) as part of International
Friendship Day (IFD) celebrations on 11 April 2025.</p>
<p>Our visitors participated in a special IFD concert and presented on their
school, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), and academic experiences. Together
with their buddies, they attended lessons and enjoyed a hands-on experience
when they proudly prepared and savoured Pad Thai during a Food and Consumer
Education (FCE) lesson.</p>
<p>This meaningful exchange provided an excellent platform for our students
to develop communication skills and global literacy, as they interacted
with peers from Hong Kong, fostering cross-cultural friendships and understanding.</p>
