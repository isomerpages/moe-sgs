<p><strong>The Level Signature Programmes (LSPs)</strong> are unique to Serangoon
Garden Secondary School and specially curated. The programmes seek to</p>
<p>(i) provide opportunities for SGSians to experience learning beyond their
classrooms, in the domains of Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and
Social (CAMPS)
<br>(ii) strengthen peer support and teacher-student rapport.</p>
<p>Every year, our students look forward to participating in LSPs, three
times a year, organized at the end of Term 1, 2 and 4. The themes are <strong>‘Discover’, “Enrich’ and ‘Celebrate’</strong> within
each LSP.</p>
<p>The theme <strong>‘Discover’</strong> is about our students exploring and
discovering their talents, passions and their heritage; the theme <strong>‘Enrich’</strong> is
about providing opportunities for our students to apply their knowledge,
skills and competencies to authentic real-world context and the last theme
is <strong>‘Celebrate’</strong> which affirms our students’ different talents
and passion in the domains of Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and
Social.</p>

<h4>Code for Fun &amp; AI for Fun</h4>
<p>The school leverages on IMDA's Code for Fun and AI for Fun programmes
to expose all Lower Secondary students to the world of computational thinking
and basic programming. Secondary One students take part in the 10 hour
CFF programme using their new PLDs based on the theme of Sustainability
Living. They then progress to AIFF in Secondary Two which applies Generative
AI to solve problems related to the theme of Sustainable Living.&nbsp;These
two programmes work in tandem to develop students' competencies in Digital
Literacy and Technological Skills, specifically in Computational Thinking
and Coding &amp; Programming. A secondary objective of the programme is
to enthuse prospective students to consider if a career in IT is for them
and if they should study Computing as an elective in Secondary Three.</p>
