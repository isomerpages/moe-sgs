<p><strong>The Level Signature Programmes (LSPs)</strong> are unique to Serangoon
Garden Secondary School and specially curated. The programmes seek to</p>
<p>(i) provide opportunities for SGSians to experience learning beyond their
classrooms, in the domains of Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and
Social (CAMPS)
<br>(ii) strengthen peer support and teacher-student rapport.</p>
<p>Every year, our students look forward to participating in LSPs, three
times a year, organized at the end of Term 1, 2 and 4. The themes are <strong>‘Discover’, “Enrich’ and ‘Celebrate’</strong> within
each LSP.</p>
<p>The theme <strong>‘Discover’</strong> is about our students exploring and
discovering their talents, passions and their heritage; the theme <strong>‘Enrich’</strong> is
about providing opportunities for our students to apply their knowledge,
skills and competencies to authentic real-world context and the last theme
is <strong>‘Celebrate’</strong> which affirms our students’ different talents
and passion in the domains of Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and
Social.</p>
