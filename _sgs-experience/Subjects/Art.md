SGS Art Unit aims to instill in our students the love for visual arts through the development of artistic skills of observation, creative expression, and appreciation.

##### Enrichment lessons and LSP Programmes
Through enrichment lessons, students are given the opportunity to work with artists to deepen their mastery of different art techniques. LSP programmes are also organised for students to develop their visual awareness and heighten their sensitivities. Students will learn how to generate ideas that express and communicate their thoughts, experiences, and feelings in visual form as well as tap into their creative imagination.

##### Art Competitions
Students are encouraged to participate in Art competitions, such as the Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition, Yellowren Inter-school Canvas Art Competition and the MTC - Design for Good Youth Competition, to further develop and enhance their interest and exposure in Art.

Through these, students will acquire applied learning skills like collaboration, research, creativity, inquiry skills and build their self-awareness. These are applicable life skills which transcend the subject and will aid students in their post-secondary education.

##### Art Exhibitions
To celebrate the creativity and artistic expression of our students, the Art unit provides platforms in school and externally to showcase their unique perspectives, techniques, and creativity to a wider audience.
