### Creative Solutions for Complex Problems
Computer science is a dynamic and rapidly growing area that has become an
integral part of the world that we live in today. Computer scientists theorise,
design, develop and apply the software and hardware for technology most of us
use every single day. As the digital world is rapidly evolving, the need for computer scientists continues to grow. Everything from finance and banking, gaming and mobile applications, to healthcare and security all require the specialist skills of professional computer scientists.

### Aims of the Computing Curriculum
SGS offers both ‘O’ Level Computing as well as Computer Applications for our NT
students.<br>
The syllabus aims to provide students with the foundation to continue with further studies in computing and skills to participate in a rapidly changing technological environment so that the concepts and skills learnt would also be applicable in other fields that require computing.

### Developing Self-directed learners in a Blended Learning Environment
Teachers harness technology to enhance teaching and learning so as to better
support self-directed and collaborative learning as well as developing the digital
literacies in our students. Students learn and develop a variety of dispositions and skills which provide them with a strong foundation from which they can go on to higher levels of learning. Through a problem-based approach, they will develop themselves as self-directed learners and learn the importance of collaboration, at the same time developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. A large number of lessons are recorded and immediately made available online for students to access anywhere, anytime.

### Building A Strong Foundation
Students will be able to use relevant application software to solve problems in
everyday context, and represent their problem solutions via data tables,
flowcharts and programming statements. They will be able to use typical office
productivity application software for word processing, multimedia presentations
and spreadsheet calculations and charts. Students will also be able to demonstrate their skills in interface design, computer drawing and image editing through blogs and web pages, as well as animated stories and games.
