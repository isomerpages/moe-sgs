### Curriculum Overview
The design process is at the heart of our Design &amp; Technology program, serving as the fundamental platform for students to conceptualize and create practical and relevant design solutions for everyday life. Our curriculum takes students through a series of design and make projects, progressively building their knowledge and skills from Secondary 1 to 4/5.

### Lower Secondary
In the lower secondary levels, students dive into the world of design and technology through engaging design-and-make projects. These projects not only help them acquire relevant knowledge but also foster the skills necessary to transform their ideas into tangible creations.

### Upper Secondary
At the upper secondary level, students move beyond the classroom to explore design opportunities within the community. They learn to identify user needs and work independently to design and prototype innovative solutions that address those needs effectively.
Throughout their journey of designing and making, students not only gain technical proficiency but also cultivate vital 21st-century competencies. These include skills such as civic literacy, global awareness, cross-cultural competence, critical and inventive thinking, as well as communication, collaboration, and information management abilities.
This curriculum aligns seamlessly with the school's vision of "Learners with Grit, Leaders with Heart," preparing our students to be resilient and compassionate leaders of tomorrow.

### Enrichment Programs
In addition to our core curriculum, we strongly encourage students to participate in various enrichment programs, such as seminars and competitions. These opportunities allow students to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom, reinforcing their learning and nurturing their innovative spirit.
