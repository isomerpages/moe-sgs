The SGS Science department aims to inculcate in our students a strong interest and joy in the learning of Science, nurture positive scientific values and attitudes by providing varied, authentic, relevant, real-world learning experiences so as to nurture effective and competent contributors. We strive to enable our students to seek data and information to validate observations of phenomena with a scientific mindset and inquiring mind, to understand scientific applications in the real world.

Programmes in the science department aim to provide an array of authentic learning experiences for students: These include the following: <br><br>
a. Partnership with external partners to provide authentic learning experiences to engage students in exploring Science beyond their classrooms. e.g. Science Centre, NUS, Polytechnics, etc. <br>
b. STEM related research activities to develop dispositions such as resilience and adaptability when they brainstormed to solve real-world issues. e.g. food security issues. <br>
c. Multidisciplinary approaches to cultivate creativity and awareness for sustainable living. e.g Hydrophonics programme. <br>
d. Yong Explorer’s Experiment Toolkit (YEET) to foster self-directed learning using home-based DIY experiments and the affordance of ICT. <br>
e. Participation in external competitions. e.g. Annual Genetic Modification Advisory Committee challenge, biennial Singapore National Crystal Growing Challenge

The challenge involves exploring the various possibility of constructing a free standing bridge out of a given number of satay sticks, to ensure that the final bridge design supports objects of approximately one kilogram in weight.
