Our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP)—‘Researching Society through Media Literacy’ (RSML) aims to nurture our students to become “Learners with grit, Leaders with heart”. It hopes to deepen our students’ 21st Century Competencies through a focus on metacognition using various thinking routines, drawing on the creativity of the students to benefit the society through the use of Design-Thinking process.

A focus on media literacy which include an appreciation of the use of media as a tool for research and advocacy as well as how to manage the use of this tool, that provides a wider outreach to the intended audience. Societal issues explored through the use of various forms of media tools including the internet, videography, photography, podcasting and social media platforms provide enhanced opportunities for our young Sgsians to demonstrate their agency in an applied context that is meaningful and compassionate.  
  
Learning Outcomes of Researching Society through Media Literacy (RSML) are:  
1\. Develop GRIT (Gratitude, Resilience and Inventive Thinking) as they gain perspectives on real-life societal issues.  
2\. Develop empathy when delivering innovative solutions to improve the community.  
3\. Develop skilful users of media tools to advance student agency. 


The programme has a 3 tier approach as shown below

Under the Tier 1 programme, all lower secondary and secondary 3 students will be trained to use Design Thinking to approach their projects. Design Thinking is used as a research tool to guide students in developing innovative ideas, prototyping the projects, and drawing on their inventing thinking to benefit the society through a strong emphasis on empathy. With this humanistic approach, students will be engaged to explore and give back to the community they are in.

Students are equipped with media literacy competencies over the course of the project to curate, create and connect information in a digital networked environment. In Secondary One, students are taught how to curate digital content and information by refining search results and verifying the credibility and currency of information across multiple sources. They also learn basic photography skills to create digital narratives of their life in school. Progressively, as they move on to Secondary Two, they acquire videography skills and deepen their ability to modify and integrate varied media elements to produce multimodal products, to project a positive influence while making informed choices on how to use information ethically. In order to enhance students’ abilities to communicate their ideas and connect with different communities, they are also taught how to present and pitch their ideas effectively and confidently.

Under the Tier 2 programme, students with higher aptitude and interest in researching societal issues and media will further hone their knowledge and skills through the talent development programme, Earth Club and Media Club. They will also be given opportunities to showcase their outstanding projects during ALP Celebration, and participate in external competitions. Progressively, in the Tier 3 programme, selected high performing students who emerged from the talent development programme will be sent for master classes and learning journeys to extend their learning. 

Students’ experiences through the RSML programme are also enhanced through our collaboration with external partners such as Halogen Foundation, Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), A* Star, who provide more opportunities for students to see the relevance of what they have studied, and spark curiosity to explore further in their post-secondary options or careers in the future.  

Upon completion of this programme, students will develop skills such as critical thinking, reasoning, analysis and media literacy skills, which are vital for the future. When carrying out their research, students have access to knowledge and perspectives on contemporary and complex societal issues which are pertinent to Singapore and the World. With informed minds, they then make better decisions and develop innovative solutions to improve the community, through use of varied technologies. SGSians will grow in confidence as self-directed learners and active contributors to the society.
