<p>Our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) — ‘Researching Society through
Media Literacy’ (RSML) aims to nurture our students to become “Learners
with grit, Leaders with heart”. It hopes to deepen our students’ 21st Century
Competencies through a focus on metacognition using various thinking routines,

<p>A focus on media literacy which include an appreciation of the use of
media as a tool for research and advocacy as well as how to manage the
use of this tool, that provides a wider outreach to the intended audience.
Societal issues explored through the use of various forms of media tools
including the internet, videography, photography, podcasting and social
media platforms provide enhanced opportunities for our young SGSians to
demonstrate their agency in an applied context that is meaningful and compassionate.</p>
<p>Learning Outcomes of Researching Society through Media Literacy (RSML)
are:</p>
<p>1. Develop GRIT (Gratitude, Resilience and Inventive Thinking) as they
gain perspectives on real-life societal issues.</p>
<p>2. Develop empathy when delivering innovative solutions to improve the
community.</p>
<p>3. Develop skilful users of media tools to advance student agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The programme has a two-tier approach as shown below</p>

<p>Under the Tier 1 programme, all lower secondary and secondary 3 students
will be trained to use Design Thinking to approach their projects. Design
Thinking is used as a research tool to guide students in developing innovative
ideas, prototyping the projects, and drawing on their inventing thinking
to benefit the society through a strong emphasis on empathy. With this
humanistic approach, students will be engaged to explore and give back
to the community they are in.</p>
<p>Students are equipped with media literacy competencies over the course
of the project to curate, create and connect information in a digital networked
environment. In Secondary One, students are taught how to curate digital
content and information by refining search results and verifying the credibility
and currency of information across multiple sources. They also learn basic
photography skills to create digital narratives of their life in school.
Progressively, as they move on to Secondary Two, they acquire videography
skills and deepen their ability to modify and integrate varied media elements
to produce multimodal products, to project a positive influence while making
informed choices on how to use information ethically. In order to enhance
students’ abilities to communicate their ideas and connect with different
communities, they are also taught how to present and pitch their ideas
effectively and confidently.</p>

<p>Under the Tier 2 programme, students with higher aptitude and interest
in researching societal issues and media will further hone their knowledge
and skills through the talent development programme, Earth Club and Media
Club. They will also be given opportunities to showcase their outstanding
projects during ALP Celebrations, and participate in external competitions.
Selected students from the talent development programme will be sent for
master classes and learning journeys to extend their learning.</p>

<p>Students’ experiences through the RSM<sup>L</sup> programme are also enhanced
through our collaboration with external partners such as Halogen Foundation,
Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), who provide more opportunities
for students to see the relevance of what they have studied, and spark
curiosity to explore further in their post-secondary options or careers
in the future.</p>
<p>Upon completion of this programme, students will develop skills such as
critical thinking, reasoning, analysis and media literacy skills, which
are vital for the future. When carrying out their research, students have
access to knowledge and perspectives on contemporary and complex societal
issues which are pertinent to Singapore and the World. With informed minds,
they then make better decisions and develop innovative solutions to improve
the community, through use of varied technologies. SGSians will grow in
confidence as self-directed learners and active contributors to the society.</p>
<p>At the end of students’ participation in the ALP, they will undergo an
evaluation based on their proficiency in 21st Century Competencies.</p>
