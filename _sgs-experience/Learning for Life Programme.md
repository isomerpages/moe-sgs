The SGS **Learning for Life Programme (LLP**) aims to nurture confident and compassionate leaders with the heart to serve the school and the community. This programmes serves to inculcate SGS student leaders with: <br>
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a growth mindset to strive for excellence, <br>
ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a progressive vision to lead others towards a common goal while having the resilience to overcome adversities,<br>
iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an entrepreneurial spirit to seek and innovate solutions,<br>
iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ability to foster collaboration and teamwork within a team, and<br>
v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a compassionate nature to empathise with people and situations.<br>

In SGS, we strongly believe that every student has the potential to be a leader and should be provided with leadership opportunities to serve and lead. Therefore, students are given the autonomy to take up leadership roles in various school settings (Class, CCA, and Student Council) to hone their leadership competencies. Through a progressive and reflective approach, students will discover their strengths and learn to be active contributors to their teams. By providing students with multiple platforms to practise and develop their leadership competencies, they can expand their sphere of influence from self, to peer and to a larger community. At the end of this programme, students will develop into future-ready leaders with the resilience and innovative thinking to embrace challenges in the future. As they continue their leadership journey after graduation from Secondary School, they will continue to lead and serve the society with compassion and a sense of gratitude.
