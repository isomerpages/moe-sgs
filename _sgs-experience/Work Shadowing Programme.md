<p>Our school organises an annual Work Shadowing Programme (WSP) to provide
our Sec 3 students with the opportunity to explore the world of work based
on their interests. Among these students also include our student leaders
from various CCAs, Student Councillors and Class Committees. Through the
programme, students discover the different types of industries in the world
of work and reflect on the skills and knowledge they would need to get
there. In addition, through the programme, students discover more about
themselves, understanding their own strengths and weaknesses and become
clearer about who they are. This year, the programme has expanded to include
up to 85 Secondary Three students, partnering 23 organisations and companies.
We would like to show our appreciation to the following companies/ organisations
for coming on board with us for this programme to provide learning opportunities
for our students.</p>
