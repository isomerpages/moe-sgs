<h3>Curriculum Overview</h3>
<p>The design process is at the heart of our Design &amp; Technology program,
serving as the fundamental platform for students to conceptualize and create
practical and relevant design solutions for everyday life. Our curriculum
takes students through a series of design and make projects, progressively
building their knowledge and skills from Secondary 1 to 4/5.</p>
<h3>Lower Secondary</h3>
<p>In the lower secondary levels, students dive into the world of design
and technology through engaging design-and-make projects. These projects
not only help them acquire relevant knowledge but also foster the skills
necessary to transform their ideas into tangible creations.</p>
<h3>Upper Secondary</h3>
<p>At the upper secondary level, students move beyond the classroom to explore
design opportunities within the community. They learn to identify user
needs and work independently to design and prototype innovative solutions
that address those needs effectively. Throughout their journey of designing
and making, students not only gain technical proficiency but also cultivate
vital 21st-century competencies. These include skills such as civic literacy,
global awareness, cross-cultural competence, critical and inventive thinking,
as well as communication, collaboration, and information management abilities.
This curriculum aligns seamlessly with the school's vision of "Learners
with Grit, Leaders with Heart," preparing our students to be resilient
and compassionate leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Enrichment Programs</h3>
<p>In addition to our core curriculum, we strongly encourage students to
participate in various enrichment programs, such as seminars and competitions.
These opportunities allow students to apply the knowledge gained in the
classroom, reinforcing their learning and nurturing their innovative spirit.</p>
