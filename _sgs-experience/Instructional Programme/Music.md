Our school has in place a **General Music Programme (GMP)** that aims to create opportunities for students to learn to perform, create and appreciate music.  
  
Students are taught instrumental performance skills such as ukulele-playing, keyboard-playing and percussion performance. Students are also encouraged to hone their creativity skills through music production and song-writing activities, using digital music tools. Students are also given opportunities to perform at school events such as the ‘SGS Got Talent’ competition and Garden Fiesta. In our comprehensive two-year GMP, students develop the ability for creative expression and communication. The programme also develops our students’ awareness of music in local and global cultures, part of our programme to guide students in learning the 21st CCs.  
  
Our school offers Normal Technical students an Upper Secondary music curriculum leading to the N-Level Music assessment at the end of their Secondary Four academic journey. Students are equipped with basic music technology skills, such as arranging popular song covers with the use of digital audio workstations (DAW). To extend learning beyond the classroom setting, upper secondary music students have the opportunity to go on experiential learning journeys to music production studios, as well as performing at an annual combined music concert, Aspire, held by the MOE Arts Education Branch and ITE College Central.
