Since its inception, the SGS Football Team has established a long and successful footballing heritage. Through the years, the team has developed and nurtured talented players who have progressed into full-fledged internationals, including Singapore’s favourite football icon Fandi Ahmad, current Singapore international striker Daniel Goh and Nepalese international midfielder Laken Limbu. Collectively, our teams have won numerous trophies and accolades in both zonal and national competitions over the years. Most recently, our C Division team successfully clinched two commendable 2nd Runner-Up trophies in 2016 and 2018, while the B Division team secured a pair of 4th placings in 2017 and 2019 at the National School Games (NSG), once again cementing our status as one of the top footballing schools in Singapore. In 2025, both B and C Division teams gave their best yet again in the aforementioned competitions, showcasing commendable fighting spirit, ambition and resilience in the process. 

In alignment with the school’s **PRIDE** values, the team aims to develop our footballers holistically through structured training sessions, NSG competitions and participation in the various Values-In-Action (VIA) activities. We believe in the inculcation of sound values in every single footballer, incorporating that of **Perseverance** in attending all training sessions and giving off one’s best efforts always, **Respect** for teachers, coaches, the team and opponents and finally, **Integrity** and **Diligence** in doing what is right at all times, both on and off the pitch. Through the Values-in-Action activities, our footballers are presented with ample opportunities to exercise **Empathy** and hone their leadership abilities through student-led initiatives to reach out to the wider community beyond school level. 

Above all, the SGS Football Team seeks to inculcate a strong sense of camaraderie and community amongst our footballers long after they graduate, while continuing to imbue a lifelong appreciation towards playing good football built on sound values and the desire to excel.
