Floorball at SGS is an exciting and fast-paced sport that hones physical skills while nurturing teamwork, discipline, and lasting friendships. Beyond the thrill of competition, our CCA emphasizes character development and giving back to the community. As part of our VIA activities, we engaged with migrant workers on their rest day, playing floorball, football, and traditional games such as five stones. These interactions created meaningful connections and allowed us to learn more about one another.

Earlier this year, our players also took the lead in introducing floorball to new students during the Sec 1 CCA Open House, passionately sharing their love for the sport and welcoming the next generation of players. We also had the opportunity to host floorball students from Punggol Cove Primary School, giving them a glimpse into secondary school training. Training together was both fun and inspiring, sparking excitement for the sport and strengthening bonds across schools.

Through competitive play, community service, and outreach, Floorball at SGS offers a rewarding and enriching experience, cultivating skills on and off the court while building strong bonds among our players.
