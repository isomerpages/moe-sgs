Floorball is an exciting, fast-paced sport that not only develops physical skills but also fosters teamwork, discipline, and lasting friendships in SGS. This year, our team proudly clinched the title of C Division League 2 champions, a testament to the hard work and dedication of our players. Beyond the thrill of competition, our CCA emphasizes character development and giving back to the community. As part of our VIA activities, we engaged with migrant workers in their dormitories, distributing food and celebrating Labour Day together, creating meaningful connections.
Earlier this year, our players took the lead in introducing Floorball to new students during the Sec 1 CCA Open House, passionately sharing their love for the sport and welcoming the next generation of players. Through both competitive play and service to the community, Floorball at SGS offers a rewarding and enriching experience, cultivating skills on and off the court and building strong bonds among our players.
