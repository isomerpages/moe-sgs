Da Whoosh Dance Club (DWDC) is the school's official dance team. A close-knit group, the dancers in our club work together to come up with choreography and help each other improve their technical dance skills. Over the years, we have been building up our repertoire of Hip Hop and Modern Contemporary dance moves. DWDC provides many opportunities for our dancers to exercise their creativity and to develop their self-confidence and leadership skills.
