**SGS Badminton** aims to instill in players the school’s PRIDE values through a core training programme put in place throughout the year. This training programme, which includes a mixture of skills and physical trainings, are not only fundamental in their time as badminton players, but the values that they learn, such as teamwork, perserverance and resilience will stay with them in their journey through life.

In 2022, SGS badminton participated in the National School Games. While it has been a challenging journey for the team, it was also a rewarding one nevertheless. While learning to manage the time juggling academic responsibilities, school duties, and badminton training, our players never stood down from the challenges. The badminton team will endeavour to bring more pride and glory to the school and give their best in every game they play.

Moving forward, we are looking to closer partnerships with other schools in friendlies and in-house tournaments. We hope that SGS badminton can soar to greater heights in 2023 and beyond.
