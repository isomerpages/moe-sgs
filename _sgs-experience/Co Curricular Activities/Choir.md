The SGS Choir aims to nurture the passion for singing, and develop each member into resilient musicians and confident performers.

The Choir encourages holistic development of members by providing a variety of project opportunities and leadership positions.

In terms of repertoire, we do not limit our musical education to choral pieces, but also dabble in busking performances and collaborations with other Performing Arts Groups in SGS, and in song writing and composition.

#### Key Programme:

In 2024, the Choir took part in the biennial Garden Fiesta School concert where in addition to choral pieces, choir members had the opportunity to perform Disney classics such as ‘A whole new world’ from Alladin. The Choir also worked with various schools through choral exchanges; our collaboration culminated in our presentation at the Voices of Singapore (VOS) Festival in 2024 held at CHIJMES. A group of Choir members also represented the school to take part in the 新空下 National Schools Xinyao Festival in 2024, composing a song titled 四年的朋友 which describes the friendships they have made in their schooling days in SGS. In 2025, the Choir participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, and was awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment.&nbsp;

The Choir also actively works with the Community through a variety of Values-in-Action (VIA) Projects. In the past 2 years, our students have planned and executed musical based projects at organizations such as Ling Kwang Home for Senior Citizens and Sunflower Preschool.**
