The Girls’ Brigade 55th Company aims to provide girls and young women with the opportunity to grow and lead, thereby developing them to their fullest potential. To equip, empower and enable every Girl to be a leader, and every Officer a Servant Leader, the company organise a holistic selection of activities such as camps, drills and badge work. These include both indoor and outdoor activities such as handicrafts, community outreach, outdoor cooking and learning journeys around Singapore. All of these will provide our girls with multiple opportunities to lead, plan and participate.
