SGS Media Club, also affectionately known as SGS Media Studio is home to students who enjoy making short films, taking photographs or working with sound systems. Students will be trained to capture school events through photography and videography, to preserve the memories of their secondary school experience. Media Club members will also be content creators, embarking on their own projects such photo journals, short films and podcasts.

#### Key Programmes
The programmes of the club are organized along 5 developmental pillars: Lead, Learn, Serve, Excel, and Discover.

**Lead**: The club aims to develop its members into reflective leaders with a growth mindset. They will have the opportunity to lead their peers in various media projects and join the CCAâ€™ executive committee to guide the development of the CCA.

**Learn:** Through the guidance of professional instructors and the teachers-in-charge, Media Club students would learn the fundamentals of photography and videography and be exposed to the use of various media equipment and software. Crucially, they will learn to be effective communicators who can send compelling messages through their media work. 

**Serve:** Media Club students learn to be leaders with heart through serving the school and the community. They provide photography and videography support for school events, teach their peers media skills, and raise awareness for good social causes through creating multimodal media products.   

**Excel:** Media Club students foster a spirit of excellence by competing in annual competitions such as the Our Schools, Our Stories photography and videography competition, DrugFreeSG video competition, and Young Reporters News Challenge. In 2024, a team of our students won first place at the Young Reporters News Challenge.

**Discover:** At Media Club, students learn beyond the classroom. Through visiting heritage sites like Chinatown and Kampong Glam, students uncover personal stories and unique sights which they retell through their media products.
