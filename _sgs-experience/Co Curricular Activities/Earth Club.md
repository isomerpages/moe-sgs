The SGS Earth Club is the driving force behind our school's sustainability movement. Aligned with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and MOE’s Eco-Stewardship Programme (ESP), we empower students to learn, act, and advocate for a greener future.

Our mission is guided by the principle of “I Know – I Do – I Advocate” and implemented through the ESP's four pillars:

*   Curriculum: We explore sustainability through interactive games, model building, and video production. Our members train Green Champs to lead their classes in growing microgreens, bringing lessons to life.
    
*   Campus: We manage our school's green spaces—Spice Green, VegePods, Green Cove, and Cacao Nook—transforming them into outdoor classrooms where we learn both traditional and high-tech farming methods.
    
*   Culture: We spearhead school-wide initiatives like the SGS Recycles Programme and lead campaigns for events like Earth Day, Flea Market, Food for Heart and World Wildlife Day, fostering an eco-conscious culture campus-wide.
    
*   Community: We extend our impact beyond school walls through partnerships with organizations like Terra SG and the Singapore Environment Council. Our members lead learning journeys and even educate preschoolers on the importance of recycling and energy saving.
