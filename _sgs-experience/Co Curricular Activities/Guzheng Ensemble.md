The SGS Guzheng Ensemble nurtures a deep appreciation for the traditional Chinese instrument in its students. Within the ensemble, students are encouraged to demonstrate perseverance and diligence, working together to refine their coordination, focus, and musicality as a team.

##### Key programmes
Members of the ensemble have numerous opportunities to perform at school events, including Lunar New Year Celebrations, Garden Fiesta, National Day Celebrations, and Semestral Awards Day. They have also showcased their talents at external events such as the President’s Challenge Charity Gala Dinner, Serangoon National Day Dinner, The French School and NEX shopping mall. 

Students also participate in combined schools concerts, offering them platforms to meet like-minded peers with a shared interest in traditional Chinese music, while honing their performance skills. These experiences help build stage confidence and performance expertise. 

In 2024, the members had the opportunity to engage in a cultural exchange with students from Ocean Reef Senior High School (ORSHS) in Australia. While SGS students performed a traditional Guzheng music piece, ORSHS students shared their rock music performances, enriching our school’s arts culture by exposing students to diverse forms of artistic expression.

The ensemble actively contributes to the community through its VIA (Values-in-Action) programme. The group visited Ling Kwang Home for Senior Citizens, where they performed for the elderly, served meals, and engaged the residents with Bingo games. The ensemble also visited Brighton Connection, an after-school student care centre supporting some students from lower-income families. The ensemble devised an exciting program, featuring activities such as hands-on Guzheng experiences and interactive games like charades.
