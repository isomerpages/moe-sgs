<p>Red Cross Youth (RCY) is one of the six Uniformed Groups in Serangoon
Garden Secondary School. We take pride in our affiliation with the world's
largest humanitarian network, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent
Movement.</p>
<p>Our core mission revolves around instilling the RCY spirit in our cadets,
emphasizing values such as compassion, passion, and professionalism. While
our primary focus is on first aid training, we also expose our cadets to
various other essential aspects, including disaster management, advocating
for blood donation, nurturing youth leadership skills, and engaging in
service learning opportunities.</p>
<p>All our cadets undergo a Standard First Aid course, equipping them with
a range of life-saving techniques, including CPR (AED). They put these
skills into practice during first aid duties, providing vital support at
school events such as Sports Fiesta and Cross Country Run. Additionally,
they test their abilities in the annual First Aid Championships, challenging
cadets from other schools to simulate emergency scenarios.</p>
<p>Our cadets extend their contributions to the broader community through
various forms of service learning projects. They plan and organize meaningful
activities for the elderly in care centers, raise funds for the annual
Grateful Hearts Day, led by the Singapore Red Cross and participate in
activities such as beach cleanup and imparting first aid knowledge to fellow
UG cadets. Through these endeavors, our cadets become active contributors
to our communities.</p>
<p>Through the Red Cross Youth Cadet curriculum and programmes, we are dedicated
to provide our cadets with the knowledge and essential life skills to become
humanitarian leaders who are adaptable, resilient and confident team players.</p>
