<h3>Creative Solutions for Complex Problems</h3>
<p>Computer science is a dynamic and rapidly growing area that has become
an integral part of the world that we live in today. Computer scientists
theorise, design, develop and apply the software and hardware for technology
most of us use every single day. As the digital world is rapidly evolving,
the need for computer scientists continues to grow. Everything from finance
and banking, gaming and mobile applications, to healthcare and security
all require the specialist skills of professional computer scientists.</p>
<h3>Aims of the Computing Curriculum</h3>
<p>SGS offers both ‘O’ Level Computing as well as Computer Applications for
our NT students.
<br>The syllabus aims to provide students with the foundation to continue
with further studies in computing and skills to participate in a rapidly
changing technological environment so that the concepts and skills learnt
would also be applicable in other fields that require computing.</p>
<h3>Developing Self-directed learners in a Blended Learning Environment</h3>
<p>Teachers harness technology to enhance teaching and learning so as to
better support self-directed and collaborative learning as well as developing
the digital literacies in our students. Students learn and develop a variety
of dispositions and skills which provide them with a strong foundation
from which they can go on to higher levels of learning. Through a problem-based
approach, they will develop themselves as self-directed learners and learn
the importance of collaboration, at the same time developing critical thinking
and problem-solving skills. A large number of lessons are recorded and
immediately made available online for students to access anywhere, anytime.</p>
<h3>Building A Strong Foundation</h3>
<p>Students will be able to use relevant application software to solve problems
in everyday context, and represent their problem solutions via data tables,
flowcharts and programming statements. They will be able to use typical
office productivity application software for word processing, multimedia
presentations and spreadsheet calculations and charts. Students will also
be able to demonstrate their skills in interface design, computer drawing
and image editing through blogs and web pages, as well as animated stories
and games.</p>
