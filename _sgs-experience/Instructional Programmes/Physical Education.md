<p>The Physical Education&nbsp;department aims to develop students to be
active, caring and healthy learners who would participate in physical activities
actively and safely, as well as understand the importance of adopting a
healthy lifestyle for their overall wellbeing. The PE curriculum provides
broad-based opportunities for students to develop PE-related competencies
in the three learning areas (Physical Activity, Outdoor Education, and
Physical Health and Safety), enabling our students to be competent and
confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living
safely and responsibly. Physical Education is also an important vehicle
to educate life skills and to imbue core values like respect, responsibility,
resilience, integrity, care and harmony. These are taught and facilitated
at every opportune teaching moment.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Activities:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school offers a range of physical activities across the various categories
of games. Students develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in
game concepts and skills across the various games. &nbsp;As students learn
and practise these skills and concepts through games and recreational competitions,
they can and transfer their skills and concepts, individually and with
others, across the different games. With enhanced movement competence,
students gain confidence to sustain their participation in physical activities
beyond their school experience.</p>
<p><strong>Outdoor Education:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our outdoor education exposes and teaches students the fundamentals to
engage and negotiate natural and urban environment that infuses a love
for the outdoors and sense of adventure in them. In this process, students
develop outdoor and environmental skills and experiences (e.g. map reading
and navigation, tent-pitching, knots tying, starting fire with firewood,
field cooking). These experiences will enable students to foster an appreciation
for the outdoors and a deeper personal connection with the places around
them and a desire to contribute to a sustainable community. Students apply
their outdoor competencies (i.e., knowledge, skills, and attitudes) during
the culminating tasks such as day trips and cohort camps where self-directed
learning experiences develop their spirit of adventure, resilience, and
deepen personal connections with the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Health and Safety:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students develop an understanding of physical health concepts, active
living, safe practices and personal hygiene. With the understanding, students
apply the skills and knowledge to participate in physical activities regularly
and safely, make healthier food choices and take care of themselves, thus
developing a sense of personal responsibility towards active and healthy
living. Students make connections between what they have learnt in class
and their environment to exhibit health-enhancing behaviours.</p>

<p><strong>Signature Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe in educating students to enjoy and appreciate living active
and healthy lifestyle through engaging in varied programmes. This is where
our students compete in intra-class and inter-class sports, ACES Day Challenges,
and Cross-Country Run. Besides, the Level Signature Programmes expose students
to physical activities that are not taught in the curriculum, allowing
them an opportunity to learn new games and skill sets.</p>
