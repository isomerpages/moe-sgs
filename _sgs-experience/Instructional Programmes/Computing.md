<h3>Creative Solutions for Complex Problems</h3>
<p>Computer science is a dynamic and rapidly growing area that has become
an integral part of the world that we live in today. Computer scientists
theorise, design, develop and apply the software and hardware for technology
most of us use every single day. As the digital world is rapidly evolving,
the need for computing experts continues to grow. Everything from artificial
intelligence, finance and banking, gaming and mobile applications, to healthcare
and security all require the specialist skills of professional computer
scientists.</p>
<h3>Aims of the Computing Curriculum</h3>
<p>Computing will be offered at G1, G2 and G3 levels for Upper Secondary
students starting 2026. The syllabus aims to provide students with the
foundation to continue with further studies in computing and skills to
participate in a rapidly changing technological environment so that the
concepts and skills learnt would also be applicable in other fields that
require computing.</p>
<p>The three levels of Computing progress from building foundational skills
to focusing on problem-solving and finally to catering to students with
a particular talent or passion for the subject. G1 Computing develops essential
software and document processing skills. G2 Computing then places a stronger
emphasis on problem-solving through more advanced spreadsheet functions
and introduces block-based programming. Finally, G3 Computing caters to
students with a demonstrated aptitude by introducing more advanced, specialized
topics such text-based programming</p>
<h3>Building A Strong Foundation</h3>
<p>Students will be able to use relevant application software to solve problems
in everyday context, and represent their problem solutions via data tables,
flowcharts and programming statements. They will be able to use typical
office productivity application software for word processing, multimedia
presentations and spreadsheet calculations and charts. Students will also
be able to demonstrate their skills in interface design, computer drawing
and image editing through blogs and web pages, as well as animated stories
and games.</p>
<p>Lower Secondary students will get a taster of the Computing curriculum
during the 20 hour Code For Fun programme in Secondary One and AI For Fun
programme in Secondary Two.</p>

<h3>Developing Self-directed learners in a Blended Learning Environment</h3>
<p>Teachers harness technology to enhance teaching and learning so as to
better support self-directed and collaborative learning as well as developing
the digital literacies in our students. Students learn and develop a variety
of dispositions and skills which provide them with a strong foundation
from which they can go on to higher levels of learning. Through a problem-based
approach, they will develop themselves as self-directed learners and learn
the importance of collaboration, at the same time developing critical thinking
and problem-solving skills. A large number of lessons are recorded and
immediately made available online for students to access anywhere, anytime.</p>
