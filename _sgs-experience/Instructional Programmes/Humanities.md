### Our Beliefs

The **Humanities** Department aims to develop students to be critical thinkers who are able to apply their learning across different contexts through authentic tasks and activities that make learning relevant and meaningful to the learner.

The Department adopts Inquiry-based learning and Making Thinking Visible pedagogies in their lessons. By sparking curiosity, students are encouraged to raise questions pertaining to real-world issues, and are guided to explore, examine, propose and evaluate solutions to these authentic issues. This motivates them to be self-directed learners and nurtures the joy of learning Humanities.

### Signature Programme
As part of the curriculum, the Department organises field trips to places in Singapore where, besides learning about Principles of Accounts, Geography, History and Social Studies, students also get to see and appreciate the beauty and success that Singapore has achieved. These include visits to the Marina Barrage, Ancient Civilization and History Museum, Sungei Buloh Wetlands, the rainforest at Botanical Gardens and others. Beyond the curriculum, applied learning activities and competitions for students are also held regularly to further their interest in the Humanities subjects and to maximise their potential.
