<h4><strong>Curriculum Overview</strong></h4>
<p>The design process is at the heart of our Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T)
programme, serving as the foundation for students to conceptualize and
create practical, meaningful solutions for everyday life. From Secondary
1 to 4/5, students engage in a progressive curriculum of design-and-make
projects that systematically build their creativity, technical knowledge,
and problem-solving skills.</p>
<h4><strong>Lower Secondary</strong></h4>
<p>At the lower secondary levels, students embark on engaging design-and-make
projects that introduce them to the exciting world of D&amp;T. These projects
not only help them acquire relevant design knowledge but also encourage
them to transform their ideas into tangible creations.</p>
<p>In 2025, as part of the Level Signature Programme, our lower secondary
students enjoyed an extended learning experience where they designed their
own personalised keychains using Tinkercad. These designs were subsequently
realised through 3D printing, giving students the opportunity to experience
the full design cycle — from ideation and digital modelling to fabrication.
This early exposure to digital design tools and modern making processes
develops their confidence and nurtures a sense of accomplishment as they
bring their ideas to life.</p>
<h4><strong>Upper Secondary</strong></h4>
<p>At the upper secondary levels, students are challenged to move beyond
the classroom to identify authentic user needs in the community and develop
design solutions that address them. They learn to work independently and
collaboratively, applying design thinking to create prototypes that are
both innovative and practical.</p>
<p>In 2025, our students had the unique opportunity to participate in a learning
journey to a professional makerspace. This experience exposed them to advanced
tools, collaborative working environments, and real-world design applications.
The visit inspired them to think more broadly about design possibilities
and to appreciate how design and technology intersect in professional industries.
Such experiences enrich their learning and prepare them to become inventive
problem-solvers equipped with 21st-century competencies such as civic literacy,
global awareness, collaboration, and critical and inventive thinking.</p>
<p>Through these authentic learning opportunities, our students are nurtured
in alignment with the school’s vision of “Learners with Grit, Leaders with
Heart,” growing into resilient, compassionate, and innovative leaders of
tomorrow.</p>
