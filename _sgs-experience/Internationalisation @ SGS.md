immersion trip to Suzhou and Shanghai. In Suzhou, students experienced
a typical school day at Pingjiang Middle School, visited the Suzhou Industrial
Park and historic sites like Master of the Nets Garden and Shantang Street,
enjoyed Suzhou’s Pingtan performance, and explored the silk industry. In
Shanghai, they learnt about urban development concepts at the Shanghai
Urban Planning Exhibition Centre, explored Xintiandi, Tianzifang, and the
Oriental Pearl Tower, wrapping up their last evening with the ERA ‘Intersection
of Time Acrobatics Show’. The trip developed students’ global awareness

<p>SGS had the pleasure of hosting students and teachers from Choi Hung Estate
Catholic Secondary School (Hong Kong SAR, China) as part of International
Friendship Day (IFD) celebrations on 11 April 2025.</p>
<p>Our visitors participated in a special IFD concert and presented on their
school, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), and academic experiences. Together
with their buddies, they attended lessons and enjoyed a hands-on experience
when they proudly prepared and savoured Pad Thai during a Food and Consumer
Education (FCE) lesson.</p>
<p>This meaningful exchange provided an excellent platform for our students
to develop communication skills and global literacy, as they interacted
with peers from Hong Kong, fostering cross-cultural friendships and understanding.</p>
<h3>Internationalisation programme 2024</h3>
<p>In 2024, two groups of Sec 3 students went on trips to Bali and Penang
respectively. Both groups had the opportunity to participate in an exchange
programme with the local schools. Students also engaged in cultural immersion
visits and experiences. Students on the Bali trip embarked on field studies
on coasts, volcanoes, tourism, and sustainability. Those on the Penang
trip visited UNESCO Heritage sites and studied local flora and fauna at
Entopia and Penang Hill. They also engaged in experiential learning activities,
such as Batik painting and glass painting.</p>
